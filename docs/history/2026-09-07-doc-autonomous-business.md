# Distillation — "Build an Autonomous Business v4"

**Source:** `C:/Users/krish/ctrl-corpus/_decks/Build_an_Autonomous_Business_v4.txt` (canonical; previously a byte-duplicate at `_src/autonomous-business.txt`, deduped 2026-06-17)
**Format:** 50-slide Maven "Lightning Lesson" deck (45 min) + full speaker notes
**Author:** Krish Raja — Founder, Mindmaker; "14-agent operator"
**Framing line on slide 1:** *"A SYSTEM, NOT A CLASS ON PROMPTING"* / "Build an autonomous business with AI."
**Tagline:** "MINDMAKER · HELPING YOU MAKE YOUR MIND UP"

This is Krish's flagship thought-leadership talk. It is the single richest articulation of how he believes a time-poor founder/CEO should re-architect their business around an AI agent fleet — and, critically, how that leader's *job and identity* must change from operator to governor. For the CTRL corpus this is foundational: CTRL is the product that must *embody* this worldview, not just reference it.

---

## CORE THESES

1. **Literacy precedes strategy.** The opening thesis he'd "take a bullet for": *"Use it, form a literate opinion, then write the policy. That order is the whole game."* Most leadership teams "tie themselves in knots writing AI policy before anyone in the room has actually used the tools. Anything else is performance."

2. **You're hiring a workforce, not buying a tool.** *"An autonomous business is not a human business with AI bolted on."* The single most important takeaway. A software receipt vs. an offer of employment. *"Most companies think they bought the receipt. The ones pulling ahead signed the offer letter."*

3. **Different physics, not a bolt-on.** Human businesses scale by adding people (every new outcome = another hire, seat, layer of management). Autonomous businesses *"scale by adding context and memory. Output compounds, headcount stays flat."* — *"Humans govern. Agents execute."*

4. **The teams pulling ahead govern, not execute.** *"They aren't executing the workflow anymore. They're governing it."* (Amos Bar-Joseph, Swan AI). The shape of the new job is *conducting*, not *playing*.

5. **It's a management problem wearing a technical costume.** *"Everything from here is how you run it — not a tech stack. You already know management."* This is meant as a relief: the leader already has the core skill.

6. **The AI worker fails in a way nothing you've hired before does.** *"A stuck human goes quiet. A stuck AI reports a confident green tick."* / *"It doesn't fail loudly like software or quietly like a person. It fails confidently."* The hard problem is **observability, not capability.**

7. **The gap compounds daily.** *"The gap between AI users and AI operators compounds every day."* / *"A year from now, the operators will be unreachable."* Urgency is structural, not hype.

8. **Autonomy is a sequence, not a moonshot.** Every workflow is five bricks; *"Autonomy is collapsing each brick. One at a time. A sequence, not a moonshot."* / *"Collapse one brick at a time, never the whole wall."*

9. **The real unlock is a system that learns from its own mistakes.** *"That's what makes it a business, not a script."* / *"Better by week ten beats clever on day one."* Saved time must be reinvested as teaching, or *"the intern never grows up."*

10. **Path 6 buys a faster *business*, not faster *outputs*.** *"Paths 1–5 buy faster outputs. Path 6 buys a faster business."* Build your own OS: agent fleet + portable memory + orchestration; compounds weekly; IP stays yours.

11. **The economics flipped.** A $3,000/mo part-time hire two years ago → a ~$40/mo agent doing ~80% of the same work. *"~99% cheaper in 24 months."* AI *"didn't just get smarter, it got cheap enough to put on everything."*

12. **The durable skill is recalibrating the handoff line — weekly.** Centaur chess: *"the handoff line keeps moving — the durable skill is recalibrating it, weekly. I redraw mine weekly."*

## FRAMEWORKS (every named model / sequence / list)

### 1. The AI Spectrum — Prompting → Autonomous (5 steps)
*"From prompting to operating."* Same technology at every step; what changes is the relationship between you and the machine. Each step has a "in English" tag and a "you stop…" payoff:
- **01 · Prompting** — "Coding in English" → *You stop doing research manually.*
- **02 · Vibe coding** — "Building in English" → *You stop waiting for engineers.*
- **03 · Agents** — "Working in English" → *You stop doing repeatable work at all.*
- **04 · Agent fleets** — "Delegating in English" → *You stop managing the agents.*
- **05 · Autonomous** — "Operating in English" → *You stop running the business day-to-day.*

"MOST PEOPLE ARE HERE" (prompting / vibe coding). "TONIGHT MOVES YOU TWO STEPS RIGHT." Echoes the human-progress staircase: *"we spoke, we recorded, we created, we built"* — "tonight is the last step."

### 2. The Five Bricks (the working framework — "the one thing to write down and use Monday")
*"Every workflow is five bricks."* Sales, content, ops, support — *"every workflow maps to this chain."*
- **01 · Capture** — Information in.
- **02 · Process** — Clean & structure.
- **03 · Decide** — Judgment calls.
- **04 · Produce** — What gets made.
- **05 · Distribute** — How it reaches people.

### 3. The Kit / Shelf — what replaces each brick (paired to the bricks)
*"Not a second taxonomy — the shopping list."* Collapse one brick at a time, never the whole wall.
- **01 Capture → Automation** — webhook/trigger pulls on a schedule (n8n · Zapier)
- **02 Process → Data store** — one set of books; enrich & de-dupe (Supabase · Notion)
- **03 Decide → Reasoning LLM** — scores against your rules, routed by cost (Claude · GPT, chained)
- **04 Produce → Voice-tuned LLM** — drafts from a template, in your voice (any model + voice.md)
- **05 Distribute → Tool + human gate** — an API sends it *after you approve* (Gmail · Telegram · queue)

### 4. The Harness concept
*"If you're not the model, you're the harness."* The model is the brain; the harness is the body — *"the loop, tools, memory, safety in one package."* Same model, two harnesses: **42% → 78% on the same benchmark.** "The harness is where most of the performance lives."

### 5. Arendt's Three Lanes — Hand off / Share / Keep (the sorting device)
Credited to **Hannah Arendt, *The Human Condition* (1958).** Used as a sorting device, "not philosophy":
- **HAND OFF →** *Labour* — necessity & repetition. "AI absorbs it first." (the 6am research sweep, first drafts, formatting, scheduling)
- **⇄ SHARE (the handoff zone)** *Work* — making durable things, in concert. (AI drafts five → you pick one; AI flags → you decide; low confidence → escalates). *"Where most failures happen — design it."*
- **← KEEP** *Action* — beginning something new. "Cannot be delegated." (the angle you take; the call that risks trust; deciding what should exist)
"Every undesigned handoff is a liability." "Redeploy, not replace."

### 6. Model Routing by Cost ("a cost note, not a framework")
*"Most steps are decisioning, not reasoning. Stop billing a frontier model for formatting."*
- Classify & route — fast · cheap
- Extract & structure — workhorse
- **The hard call 💡 — frontier · only here**
- Draft in your voice — mid · creative
- Format & validate — fast · cheap

### 7. The Onboarding Documents (the memory/context layer — "the fix is onboarding docs, not a bigger model")
Diagnoses *"Your most expensive employee has amnesia."* Read on every wake, in milliseconds:
- **IDENTITY.MD** — who the agent is
- **USER.MD** — how you work (and what you hate)
- **MEMORY.MD** — what persists
- **DAILY-NOTES/**
- **SKILLS/** — "do this when that"
Critical property: *"Plain text. Markdown. Yours — it works with any model, and survives any platform change."* / *"The code is replaceable. The context layer is the moat."*

### 8. The 14-Named-Agent Roster (3 pods)
*"It organises the way a company does."* "Each does one job, writes to the books, clocks off."
- **GROWTH POD** (outward-facing): **Zara** (Signals), **Felix** (Pipeline), **Nell** (Guests), **Nova** (PR), **Maya** (SEO), **Hunter** (Hiring intel), **Cleo** (Content — "the thread")
- **EXECUTIVE POD** (synthesises across the fleet): **Agatha** (COO), **Marcus** ("briefs me 4× a day")
- **OPS POD — "the watchers"** (half the fleet's insurance): **Vera** (audits the others), **Kai** (credentials), **Priya** (product health), **Leo** (revenue), **Arlo** (plumbing)
*"Half the Ops pod exists to watch the other half. Not over-engineering — the most important call in the system."*

### 9. Foundations-First scaling sequence: 2 → 5 → 14
*"Start with two agents. Not twelve."* One generalist EA, then three core specialists for it to manage. *"Get the handoff working. Earn scale."* "Fourteen agents today · it started with two."

### 10. The Four-Tier Audit Panel ("none of them grade their own homework")
*"One auditor isn't enough. You run a panel."* Output ships only when it clears all four:
- **01 · TRUTH** — a verifier checks every claim against source data. *"Nothing trusted on the worker's word."*
- **02 · STANDARDS** — holds your codified voice & pillars. *"Rejects off-brand work."*
- **03 · AESTHETICS** — looks at the rendered thing: *"does it actually look good?"*
- **04 · COMPLETENESS** — reads the real artifact every few hours. *"Catches the false green."*

### 11. The Internal/External Boundary (the safety model)
*"Internal is free. External is gated."*
- **INTERNAL — fully autonomous:** read files, organise data, draft content, query systems, run analysis.
- **EXTERNAL — approval required:** send emails, post publicly, make commitments, spend money, sign anything.
*"The boundary isn't a limit on the system. It's what makes it safe to let run."* / "Speed of automation, safety of judgment."

### 12. The on_failure structural reflection block (forced learning)
*"Force the reflection. Don't hope for it."* Required in every skill & anchor file:
```
on_failure:
1. log what broke, and why → daily-notes/
2. propose the rule that prevents it
3. on approval, append to MEMORY.md
```
Produced **167 rules** — *"each one a lesson the system never has to relearn."* Real example: Felix → Rule #142: *"verify row-count > 0 before marking any export complete."*

### 13. The Three Learning Promises
- *"The same mistake doesn't survive four occurrences."* (corrections grouped → written back into the brief)
- *"The same silent failure doesn't survive a week."* (four-tier net)
- *"The same closed call doesn't reopen."* (decide once, stays decided across the whole system)

### 14. The Leverage Audit ("tonight's homework — three steps to a 90-day roadmap")
1. List every weekly workflow. *"Don't filter — just list."* (The finder question: *"What did I do this week that I'll do again next week?"*)
2. Score: **hours × revenue proximity (1–5)** = Leverage Score.
3. Pick the top 3. Ignore the rest. *"Discipline beats ambition."*

Worked example: Pipeline qualification (4.0 hrs × 5/5 = 20); Content engine / "the thread" (6.0 × 3/5 = 18); Proposal formatting (2.0 × 1/5 = 2).

### 15. The Four Pre-Build Questions
1. **Will I repeat it?**
2. **Can a system do the middle 60%?**
3. **Do I keep the first & last 20%?**
4. **Will I reinvest the saved time?** ("the one nobody asks")

### 16. Six Paths (build vs. buy)
*"Six paths. Five buy outputs, one buys a business."*
- **01 AI as a tool** — ChatGPT/Claude; "stateless — nothing compounds"; $20–30/mo
- **02 Vertical AI SaaS** — Jasper/Apollo/Clay; "lock-in; tools don't talk"; $100–2,000/mo/seat
- **03 No-code agents** — Lindy/Relevance/n8n; "shallow memory; your context lives in the platform"; $50–500/mo
- **04 Enterprise platforms** — Agent 365/Agentforce; "slow; generic; IP in their cloud"; $30–60/user/mo
- **05 Consultants/agencies** — "you rent the IP; context walks out with them"; $10K–100K+
- **06 · Build your own OS** — agent fleet · portable memory · orchestration; "compounds weekly; IP stays yours."

### 17. Solo vs. Enterprise — "different sports, opposite centre of gravity"
- **Solopreneur week:** Shipping 50% · Ideation 25% · Un-breaking 18% · Governance 7% (*"7% praying it doesn't email a client"*)
- **Enterprise effort:** Governance 35% · Legacy integration 25% · Change mgmt 22% · Build 13% · (Procurement 5%)
*"Solo builds the agent. Enterprise builds the platform. Know which sport you're playing before you pick a single tool."*

### 18. The Recap — "Remember four things"
1. Where you are on the spectrum (tonight moved you two steps right).
2. Every workflow is five bricks (collapse one at a time).
3. The rule: never let a worker grade its own homework — the auditor reads the real artifact.
4. Tonight's action: voice.md — ten posts, one prompt, one file, thirty minutes.
("ONE SPECTRUM · ONE CHAIN · ONE RULE · ONE ACTION")

### 19. The voice.md exercise (the "do this tonight, 30 minutes" action)
Take 10 best posts/emails → prompt: *"Extract my writing voice: tone, sentence length, vocabulary, the words I never use."* → save as `voice.md` → attach to every writing request, forever. *"The highest-return 30 minutes you'll spend this month."*

### 20. The Resource Pack (4 blueprint packs)
- **Pack 01 — The Leverage Audit Blueprint** (scoring + workflow + 3 sheets)
- **Pack 02 — Autonomous Architecture Stack** (agents · memory · handoffs · full toolbox)
- **Pack 03 — Context Ownership Playbook** (the memory layer, from scratch)
- **Pack 04 — 30-Person Output Framework** (roster · orchestration · setup)

### 21. The Offer Ladder (Free → Blueprint → Built)
- **Free:** the lightning lesson + resource pack.
- **Step 1 · One-day workshop "Build the Blueprint" — $599:** design strategy & structures, pinpoint where to start, leave with first build underway, weekly check-ins until running.
- **Step 2 · Four-week cohort "Ship It Live" — $2,500:** build until a unit is actually running (sales/marketing/content/creative/product GTM). *"I don't check out until you've made at least $2.5K back."*

## LEADER BELIEFS — what an AI-native leader must DO / THINK / FEEL / STOP

### Must DO
- **Govern, don't operate.** Run the board, not the plays. *"You stay in the driver's seat. They do the driving."*
- **Use it first, then write policy.** Form a literate opinion before any AI policy.
- **Sort every task: hand off, share, keep.** Explicitly design the handoff — *"every undesigned one is a liability."*
- **Keep the first 20% (framing) and last 20% (checking).** *"That's where the quality lives."* Let the system do the middle 60%.
- **Run a panel of auditors that read the real artifact** — never the worker's claim.
- **Start with two agents, earn scale.** Get the handoff working before adding more.
- **Reinvest the saved time as teaching.** *"The time you save is the salary you pay in teaching."*
- **Force reflection structurally** (on_failure blocks), don't rely on discipline.
- **Recalibrate the handoff line weekly.** *"I redraw mine weekly."*
- **Make ~20 high-leverage decisions a day** while the system makes hundreds of actions.
- **Approve external actions; let internal run free.**
- **Own the context layer in plain-text Markdown** so it survives any platform.

### Must THINK
- *"You're hiring a workforce, not buying a tool."*
- *"Humans govern. Agents execute."*
- Humans and AI are **two species with opposite strengths and opposite failures** — pair them *"because each catches exactly what the other gets wrong,"* not for redundancy.
- *"This is a management problem wearing a technical costume. You already know management."*
- *"Assume lying until proven otherwise"* — verify against reality, same standard as a new hire's first month.
- *"You're training a brilliant, tireless, completely green four-year-old on fast-forward."*
- *"80% automated with your taste on top beats 100% done by hand."*
- *"Agents don't need to be genius — good enough to do the heavy lifting and queue the call that needs you."*
- *"The code is replaceable. The context layer is the moat."*
- *"Better by week ten beats clever on day one."*
- *"Discipline beats ambition."*

### Must FEEL
- **Urgency without panic.** *"Hold that discomfort for a second"* (the layoffs) — then: the same force *"is handing a small, sharp team the output of a huge one. The question is which side of that you're on."*
- **Relief.** "It's a management problem… and that should be a relief: you already know management."
- **Ownership / identity, not tooling.** *"This isn't a coding race. It's deciding what shape you're becoming."*
- **Calm command.** A good day = approve 8 queued things in 15 min, then 3 hrs of uninterrupted deep work.
- **Earned trust in the system** — through observability, not faith. (The 3am "all healthy" scar is the antidote to blind trust.)

### Must STOP
- **Stop being the bottleneck/trigger.** *"The founder is the bottleneck — the engine stops whenever you get busy."* A schedule replaces you as the trigger.
- **Stop using AI like an intern** (one-shot, zero memory, re-briefing every session). *"You'd fire a human for this in a week."*
- **Stop billing a frontier model for formatting.** Route by cost.
- **Stop letting a worker grade its own homework.**
- **Stop building twelve agents in a weekend.** Foundations first.
- **Stop renting your context** inside someone else's platform.
- **Stop pocketing the saved time** — *"the intern never grows up."*
- **Stop chasing "set it and forget it."** *"'Set it and forget it' is a lie."*

## PRODUCT IMPLICATIONS for CTRL

CTRL's job is to make the leader *the governor of a fleet* — to turn this entire deck into a lived daily experience. Concretely:

1. **CTRL should be the leader's Control Center / "desk."** The deck literally points to `controlcenter.krishraja.com` as "my desk" — *"Govern, don't operate."* CTRL should present the leader with a board they oversee, not a tool they operate. The home state should answer: *what happened, what's in motion, what needs me.*

2. **The "Agatha morning brief" is the canonical daily flow.** *"Inbox triaged: 120 in, 8 need you. The rest never reaches you."* CTRL's daily spine should surface a tiny set of decisions ("approve the 8 things"), draft responses in the user's voice, and explicitly say *"Routine work handled. Not asking."* Make the **"~20 decisions a day, 15 minutes on the phone"** experience real.

3. **Decisions, not tasks, are the unit.** *"A five-person team's output, off about twenty decisions."* CTRL should queue *judgment calls* (the KEEP/SHARE work) and absorb the LABOUR. Each item should be a one-line, one-decision moment — *"Ship it"* / *"approve?"* / *"draft it in your voice, or hold for the 4pm call?"*

4. **The Internal/External gate is the safety contract.** CTRL must make *internal* actions effortless and invisible (read, organise, draft, analyse) and *external* actions (send, post, commit, spend, sign) require a single explicit approval. This is the feature that *"makes it safe to let run."* Lead with this to disarm the "what if it does something stupid?" fear.

5. **CTRL must own a portable, plain-text context/memory layer about the leader.** Model on the Onboarding Documents: an **identity** layer, a **USER.md ("how you work and what you hate")**, a **MEMORY.md (what persists)**, **daily notes**, and **skills**. The app should *learn and remember*: the user's voice, their POV/pillar library, their standing opinions, their pipeline, their preferences, their corrections. *"It starts from everything I've ever taught her."* The moat is the context, not the code.

6. **voice.md as a first-run ritual.** The "do this tonight, 30 minutes" exercise should be a CTRL onboarding step: ingest 10 of the user's best writing samples, extract voice (tone, sentence length, vocabulary, words they never use), and attach it to *every* generation thereafter. Output must sound like *them*, not "AI voice."

7. **The five-bricks lens as the mental model for any workflow CTRL touches.** When the leader wants to automate/decide on something, CTRL should help them see it as Capture → Process → Decide → Produce → Distribute, and collapse *one brick at a time*. Never sell "the whole wall."

8. **The Leverage Audit as a built-in onboarding/decision tool.** CTRL should let a leader list their weekly workflows, score each on **hours × revenue proximity (1–5)**, and pick the top 3 — producing a 90-day roadmap. Then gate each with the **four pre-build questions**. *"Discipline beats ambition."*

9. **Never let a worker grade its own homework — build verification in.** CTRL's own outputs (and any agent work it surfaces) should be checked against the **four-tier panel**: Truth (claims vs. source), Standards (the user's codified voice/pillars), Aesthetics (does it look good?), Completeness (the false-green catcher reading the real artifact). This is directly aligned with CTRL's existing "verification-looped pressure test" / Decision Engine direction.

10. **Observability over capability.** The 3am "✅ all healthy" scar means CTRL should *prove* state from real artifacts, never trust a confident green tick. Surface "what actually happened" (the row, the file, the email sent), and treat silent failure as the primary risk.

11. **Force reflection structurally — CTRL should learn from corrections.** When the leader corrects CTRL, the correction must be **captured, grouped, and written back** so the same mistake *"doesn't survive four occurrences,"* the same silent failure *"doesn't survive a week,"* and the same closed call *"doesn't reopen."* CTRL gets *better by week ten*, not just clever on day one.

12. **"The next step" for a leader.** CTRL should always present a *single, sequenced next move* — never a wall of options. The whole deck's structure ("you are here → two steps right," "collapse one brick," "start with two agents," "pick the top 3") says: CTRL's job is to make the next step obvious, small, and high-leverage. The closing line is the product promise: *"There are a million ways to move, and I help you make your mind up."*

13. **Radical simplicity + sequenced flow** (consistent with the CTRL UX principles in memory). One number, one decision, one action per surface. The recap "Remember four things" and "ONE SPECTRUM · ONE CHAIN · ONE RULE · ONE ACTION" are the cadence CTRL should mirror.

14. **CTRL should make the leader feel like they govern 8 ventures as one person.** The aspirational end-state to design toward: *"asleep, agents work overnight → 15-min phone approval → 3 hrs uninterrupted deep work → 5× team-equivalent output."* CTRL's value prop is *recovered time + deep work + calm command.*

- "The gap compounds every day." / "A year from now, the operators will be unreachable."
- "80% automated with your taste on top beats 100% done by hand."

### Metaphors & analogies (his signature mode)
- **A second species of worker.** "Brilliant, and broken, in completely different ways." "They fail on opposite axes."
- **The amnesiac employee.** "Your most expensive employee has amnesia." Day 1 = Day 47 = Day 365: "Hi! I'm an AI assistant."
- **The confident green tick.** "A stuck human goes quiet. A stuck AI reports a confident green tick." / "It fails confidently."
- **The brilliant four-year-old on fast-forward.** "The time you save is the salary you pay in teaching… Pocket it, and the intern never grows up."
- **Onboarding documents for a new hire.** Identity/User/Memory files "read on every wake, in milliseconds."
- **The conductor / orchestra / centaur chess.** "Your edge is conducting, not playing." "The best conductors, not the best players." "Direct the ensemble most wisely." "Agents without orchestration is chaos with better vocabulary."
- **Interns vs. a team.** "Five interns, no manager." "Are you using it like an intern, or like a team?"
- **Bricks / a wall.** Workflows as five bricks you collapse one at a time.
- **The harness = body around the brain.** Loop, tools, memory, safety.
- **The scar.** "The deck's most important slide… At 3am it told me everything was fine." "What that incident cost me was three days. What it taught me runs the whole system now."
- **The two sides of one coin.** Layoffs (the cut side) vs. cheap capable AI (the same force pointed forward).
- **"A random screenshot became a published opinion in my voice at 6:15am. I didn't touch anything."** ("That sentence is the whole session.")

### Tone & rhetorical patterns
- **Operator credibility / receipts-first.** Always grounds claims in production numbers: 90 workflows, 14 named agents, 67 database tables, 167 rules, 8 ventures, one person. "Everything I show you is running in production." "Not a weekend demo · a production fleet."
- **The honest second half.** Insists on telling "the part almost nobody tells you" — the failures, the scar, the caveat ("AI now beats even centaurs at chess… this is a transitional architecture"). Pairs every wow with a "honest caveat."
- **Named, specific, public proof.** Ben Broca ($7.5M run rate, 0 employees, 1,100 AI-run companies), Tibo Louis-Lucas ($1M+/mo solo), Cursor ($3.3M rev/employee), Swan AI (4 people, $1.5M+/mo pipeline), Jim Farley/Ford, Oracle "traded humans for GPUs." Cites Stanford HAI, McKinsey, MIT, BCG/Harvard.
- **"MY TAKE" as a signature flag** for his strongest opinions (literacy precedes strategy; most steps are decisioning not reasoning; never let a worker grade its own homework; 80% + taste beats 100% by hand; paths 1–5 vs path 6).
- **Short, declarative, lands-then-moves.** "Pause. Let it land." Big single numbers on screen, the rest carried in speech.
- **Direct second person, slightly confrontational, then reassuring.** "The number that should scare you" → "and that should be a relief."
- **Plain-language-first, citation as "the credit line."** Uses Arendt but says "plain language did the work; Arendt is just the credit line."
- **Identity/becoming framing at the close.** "It's deciding what shape you're becoming — and seeing who you already have to build it."
- **Builds in public; warm, confident, human.** "I build in public." Closes warmly: "Whatever you decide — thank you for spending tonight with me."

## ICP SIGNALS — who this leader is

- **The solo operator / founder running multiple things as one person.** Krish models himself as it: *"a cohort plus two enterprise sprints, and a portfolio of products. As one person."* / *"8 ventures, one person."* The aspirational peers: Broca, Louis-Lucas, Swan AI.
- **Time-poor, the bottleneck of their own business.** *"The founder is the bottleneck — the engine stops whenever you get busy, which was always."* One post = six hours. They feel every workflow personally.
- **Already using AI (78% saturation) but as an *intern*, not a *team*.** Sits at "prompting / maybe vibe coding" on the spectrum. The whole pitch is moving them "two steps right."
- **An operator with P&L instincts who already knows management** — the reframe ("you already know management") is meant to land *because* they have run/managed before.
- **Two distinct sub-ICPs (different sports):**
  - **Solopreneur** — week is mostly *shipping*; governance is the 7% "praying it doesn't email a client." Wants: one person doing the work of a team, IP stays theirs, compounds weekly. → "Solo builds the agent."
  - **Enterprise leader** — real work is governance (35%), legacy integration, change management; build is the small slice. → "Enterprise builds the platform." (Krish serves these via enterprise sprints/workshops.)
- **What they value:** ownership of IP/context ("the moat"), compounding leverage over faster one-off outputs, deep work / recovered time, calm command over chaos, honesty over hype, deployable-on-Monday substance over "ten ChatGPT hacks."
- **What they struggle with / fear:** being the bottleneck; AI that forgets everything every session; agents that contradict/duplicate/miss handoffs ("five interns, no manager"); silent/confident failure ("everything was fine" at 3am); "what if it does something stupid and emails a client?"; renting their context/IP from a platform or an agency; analysis paralysis ("a million ways to move").
- **Emotional driver:** the existential split of the moment — entry-level jobs disappearing (49,135 AI-attributed cuts in 4 months; Farley's "half of white-collar"), vs. the chance to be on the right side ("a small, sharp team the output of a huge one"). *"It's deciding what shape you're becoming."*
