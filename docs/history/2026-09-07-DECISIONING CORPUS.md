# Decision-Clarity Framework for High-Stakes AI Adoption
### A Product Framework for Time-Poor CEOs and Founders

***

> **Purpose of this document:** A citation-backed, exhaustive reference that powers a decision-clarity tool. The tool does not make recommendations — it decomposes decisions, maps evidence quality onto each component, and is scrupulously honest about where external sources and AI are unreliable.

***

## Part 1 — Decision-Decomposition Taxonomy

*Drawing on decision science, technology-adoption theory, real-options valuation, procurement/build-vs-buy literature, and corporate strategy.*

### 1.1 Master Taxonomy

Every high-stakes AI adoption decision resolves into twelve primary dimension families. Each family contains sub-components. The ⚠️ flag marks components executives most frequently overlook or systematically underweight.

***

#### Dimension 1: Direct Economics / Total Cost of Ownership

The full lifecycle cost of acquiring, deploying, running, and exiting a capability — not just the purchase price or headline API cost.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Acquisition cost | Licence fee, contract commitment, or build sprint cost | No |
| Infrastructure / compute | Cloud, GPU, storage, networking over the solution lifetime | Partial |
| Inference cost at scale | For AI specifically: inference almost always exceeds training cost over a model's lifespan[^1] | **Yes** |
| Integration cost | Middleware, API connectors, data-pipeline plumbing | **Yes** |
| Ongoing maintenance | Bug fixes, model retraining, security patches; typically 15–25% of initial cost annually[^2] | **Yes** |
| Training & change management | Employee onboarding, documentation, adoption programs; $10K–$25K upfront plus recurring[^2] | **Yes** |
| Governance / compliance overhead | Audit trails, compliance automation, risk-tiering reviews[^3] | **Yes** |
| Shadow AI / unapproved tool costs | Teams adopting unapproved tools independently; creates hidden IP and security liability[^4] | **Yes** |
| Migration / exit cost | Reverse engineering vendor dependencies, data migration, retraining; average $315K per project[^5] | **Yes** |
| Opportunity cost | Engineering capacity consumed; what else could the team have built?[^6] | **Yes** |
| "LLMflation" TCO shift | As token costs fall ~10× annually, the relevant metric shifts from "price per token" to "total cost per business outcome" | **Yes** |

**Key executive insight:** A $100K AI software purchase typically requires $200–400K in first-year additional spend for infrastructure, personnel, and integration — costs that recur annually. McKinsey estimates model drift and governance gaps alone cause ~30% of AI value loss.[^4][^7]

***

#### Dimension 2: Strategic Fit

Whether the capability serves, differentiates, or dilutes the business's competitive position.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Core differentiator vs. commodity | Does this capability make you unique, or is it table stakes? Build differentiators; buy commodities[^6] | No |
| Strategic alignment | Does the AI initiative align to business objectives vs. being a tech-driven project without business rationale?[^8] | **Yes** |
| IP / proprietary-asset creation | Does building create a defensible data/model asset competitors cannot replicate? | **Yes** |
| Platform vs. point-solution fit | Does this fit into a coherent capability pathway, or is it an isolated tool?[^9] | **Yes** |
| Regulatory positioning | Does early adoption lock in compliance advantage or create first-mover regulatory exposure?[^10] | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 3: Capability & Skills

Whether the organization has — or can acquire — the human capability to execute, operate, and evolve the solution.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Current internal expertise | Does the team have skills to build and maintain this now?[^6] | No |
| Talent acquisition feasibility | Can needed AI talent be hired, given competition from tech firms?[^11] | Partial |
| Skill half-life | AI skills depreciate rapidly; what is the ongoing reskilling requirement? | **Yes** |
| AI literacy of end-users | 48% of US employees would use AI tools more often if they received formal training[^12] | **Yes** |
| Change management capability | 83% of AI adoption fails due to organizational, not technical, failures[^13] | **Yes** |
| Knowledge transfer risk | When a vendor relationship ends, does institutional knowledge walk out with them? | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 4: Switching & Integration Cost

The friction and cost of changing from the current state to the new capability — and back if needed.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Technical integration complexity | API connectors, data pipeline re-architecture, legacy system compatibility[^14] | Partial |
| Data migration cost | Moving proprietary training/fine-tuning data across platforms; $10K–$25K per project[^5] | **Yes** |
| Workflow re-engineering | AI tools introduced without redesigning workflows lead to employees reverting to manual processes[^8] | **Yes** |
| Organizational transition cost | Cross-functional re-alignment, role redefinition, process documentation | **Yes** |
| Contract lock-in clauses | Renewal pricing caps, downgrade rights, early termination fees often absent or under-negotiated[^15] | **Yes** |
| Abstraction layer investment | Building multi-provider abstraction layers upfront prevents ~$315K migration projects later[^5] | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 5: Reversibility / Lock-in

The Amazon Type 1 / Type 2 door test: can you walk back this decision without catastrophic cost?[^16]

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Decision reversibility classification | One-way door (Type 1) vs. two-way door (Type 2)[^17] | No |
| Technical lock-in depth | Proprietary APIs, fine-tuned models, bespoke deployment tooling, workflow glue[^18] | **Yes** |
| Data lock-in | Training data, fine-tuning datasets, and embedded workflow logic may be owned or contaminated by vendor[^19] | **Yes** |
| Organisational lock-in | Workforce skills, culture, and process re-built around a specific vendor's paradigm | **Yes** |
| Strategic lock-in | Path dependency — early choices constrain later strategic options (real option destruction)[^20] | **Yes** |
| Lock-in timeline | AI lock-in typically manifests within 18–24 months of deployment[^19] | **Yes** |

**Key executive insight:** Only 42% of organizations that attempted an AI vendor migration reported it went smoothly. AI lock-in is harder to unwind than CRM dependency because of embedded model behavior, training data, and workflow logic.[^18][^19]

***

#### Dimension 6: Risk (Security, Compliance, Reliability)

Downside exposures the decision creates or inherits.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Security / cyber risk | Attack surface expansion, adversarial inputs, model poisoning[^3] | Partial |
| Compliance & regulatory classification | EU AI Act four-tier risk classification is use-case-dependent, not tool-dependent[^21] | **Yes** |
| Data sovereignty & privacy | Where does data go? Does it train models benefiting other orgs? GDPR implications?[^22] | Partial |
| AI hallucination / reliability risk | 47% of businesses using AI have made at least one major decision based on false AI output[^23] | **Yes** |
| Third-party concentration risk | Systemic risk amplified by single-provider dependence; flagged by FSB for financial sector[^24] | **Yes** |
| Model drift risk | Performance degrades silently over time without retraining monitoring[^4] | **Yes** |
| Attribution & accountability risk | When AI influences decisions, liability and oversight structures are reshaped invisibly[^25] | **Yes** |
| Regulatory timeline risk | EU AI Act high-risk obligations for deployers begin August 2026[^10] | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 7: Competitive Dynamics

How the decision affects relative competitive position — both advantage gained and disadvantage created.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Competitor adoption status | Where are competitors in adoption relative to you? | No |
| First-mover vs. fast-follower advantage | Research shows an inverted U-shaped relationship between AI adoption pace and competitive advantage[^26]; the curve is moderated by IT executive depth and digital complementary assets | **Yes** |
| Commoditization risk | Adopting AI for functions where it rapidly becomes table stakes vs. building genuine moat | **Yes** |
| AI moat defensibility | Fine-tuning on proprietary data creates defensible assets; pure API wrappers are discounted by investors as vulnerable | **Yes** |
| Talent market signalling | Early AI adoption attracts AI talent; late movers struggle to recruit[^27] | **Yes** |
| Customer expectation shift | AI adoption changes customer expectations in ways that make non-adoption increasingly unacceptable | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 8: Technology Maturity & Timing

Where the specific technology sits on the maturity curve, and whether waiting has positive or negative option value.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Gartner Hype Cycle position | GenAI entered the Trough of Disillusionment in 2025; AI agents and multimodal AI are at peak of inflated expectations[^28][^29] | No |
| Technology readiness level | Proof-of-concept vs. production-ready vs. mature enterprise platform | No |
| Standard/interface stability | Are APIs, data formats, and integration standards stable, or will they require costly rewrites? | **Yes** |
| Obsolescence risk | AI infrastructure economics change rapidly; payback periods <6 months favor building; >12 months create obsolescence risk | **Yes** |
| Option value of waiting | Deferral has real option value when uncertainty is high; exercising prematurely destroys option value[^30] | **Yes** |
| Compounding advantage clock | Early adopters accumulate institutional knowledge that creates compounding advantages; 2025 BCG study found AI-leading companies achieved ~1.7× higher revenue growth[^31] | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 9: Organisational & People Factors

The human system the decision must pass through and live inside.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Executive alignment | AI initiatives without cross-functional leadership buy-in fail at the governance layer[^8] | No |
| Employee resistance & fear | ~70% of change initiatives fail; AI amplifies this because employees fear job displacement[^32] | Partial |
| Governance ownership | Who owns AI governance? If nobody, it defaults to restriction[^11] | **Yes** |
| Role identity threat | Roles are shifting beneath people's feet without anyone naming the change[^11] | **Yes** |
| AI centre of excellence | Absence of a central hub for lessons and standards causes innovations to vanish into data silos[^33] | **Yes** |
| Cultural AI literacy | Decision-makers may lack AI knowledge, making it difficult to prioritize and fund initiatives correctly[^32] | **Yes** |
| Incentive alignment | Are individual incentives aligned to make the adoption succeed, or does the current system reward resistance? | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 10: Data Readiness & Quality

Whether the organization's data infrastructure can support the AI capability being considered.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Data quality & completeness | AI models require clean, structured, and integrated data[^8]; 57% of organizations still struggle with AI-ready data[^34] | Partial |
| Data volume sufficiency | Does the organization have 12+ months of historical transactional data relevant to the use case?[^35] | **Yes** |
| Data access & query speed | Can authorized users query data in hours, not days?[^35] | **Yes** |
| Data governance maturity | Are ownership, stewardship, access controls, and audit trails in place?[^36] | **Yes** |
| Proprietary data as strategic asset | Is there unique proprietary data that, if used for fine-tuning, would create a durable moat? | **Yes** |
| Training data contamination risk | Does vendor use of your data to train their general models create IP or competitive risk?[^22] | **Yes** |
| Real-time data availability | Time-sensitive AI decisions require real-time feeds, not batch exports | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 11: Second-Order & Systemic Effects

Downstream consequences the decision sets in motion beyond the immediate use case.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow & process ripple effects | Automating one process changes upstream and downstream processes; AI without process redesign creates inefficiencies[^8] | **Yes** |
| Labour market / workforce effects | Job displacement, role redefinition, and productivity shifts at scale | **Yes** |
| Systemic risk concentration | Single-provider dependence at sector level amplifies fragility; flagged by FSB[^24] | **Yes** |
| Accountability structure changes | Embedding AI in decision-support reshapes attribution, oversight, and escalation responsibilities invisibly[^25] | **Yes** |
| Regulatory precedent risk | Early deployment in an unregulated category may lock in practices that later become non-compliant | **Yes** |
| Ecosystem dependency creation | Does the capability, once embedded, make your entire value chain dependent on AI availability? | **Yes** |
| Energy & infrastructure externalities | Large-scale AI deployment creates energy, compute, and sustainability obligations[^24] | **Yes** |

***

#### Dimension 12: Option Value / Real Options

The strategic value of preserving future choices rather than committing fully.

| Sub-component | Definition | ⚠️ Often Missed? |
|---|---|---|
| Option to defer | Value of waiting until uncertainty resolves; deferral has explicit option value[^30] | Partial |
| Option to expand | Initial pilot as a call option on full deployment; keep it cheap and reversible[^37] | Partial |
| Option to abandon | Right to exit if the initiative underperforms; ensure exit is contractually possible[^38] | **Yes** |
| Option to switch | Right to change vendors or architecture without catastrophic cost | **Yes** |
| Platform option creation | Does this investment open future capabilities not yet specified?[^20] | **Yes** |
| Option destruction from premature commitment | Locking into a specific vendor/architecture forecloses future options; the option has real economic value[^39] | **Yes** |

## Part 2 — Source-of-Truth & Reliability Map

For each dimension, this table classifies the reliable source of truth across six categories: (a) public external evidence, (b) published expert theory/analysis, (c) market/competitor/sentiment signals, (d) vendor claims [with trust level], (e) internal-only tacit knowledge, (f) genuinely unknowable/forecast-only.

| Dimension | (a) Public Evidence | (b) Expert Theory | (c) Market/Competitor | (d) Vendor Claims [trust] | (e) Internal-Only | (f) Unknowable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. TCO / Economics** | Benchmark pricing, cloud cost calculators, analyst TCO studies[^2] | Academic TCO frameworks, McKinsey/Deloitte analyses[^40] | Competitor spend signals via hiring data, earnings calls | Vendor pricing sheets [**LOW** — exclude integration, maintenance, exit costs] | Your actual usage patterns, team capacity, ops overhead | Future pricing trajectories |
| **2. Strategic Fit** | Industry reports, Gartner positioning[^28] | Porter's Five Forces, resource-based view[^6] | Competitor product/hiring signals | Vendor "strategic alignment" narratives [**VERY LOW**] | Your core differentiation, product strategy, customer insight | Future competitive landscape |
| **3. Capability/Skills** | LinkedIn job market data, salary benchmarks[^41] | Change management research (ADKAR, Kotter)[^32] | Talent availability signals | Vendor implementation support claims [**MEDIUM**] | Internal skills audit, team capacity, actual literacy levels | Future talent supply |
| **4. Switching/Integration** | Open-source migration case studies, integration cost benchmarks[^5] | Switching cost theory, transaction cost economics | Peer company migration stories (Reddit, forums) | Vendor portability/migration claims [**LOW**] | Your specific architecture, tech debt, data structures | Effort of specific migration not yet attempted |
| **5. Reversibility/Lock-in** | Published lock-in case studies; Zapier survey (42% migrations smooth)[^18] | Real options theory[^37][^30] | Community reports of vendor behavior at renewal | Vendor claims of easy migration [**VERY LOW**] | Depth of your current vendor embedding | How vendor pricing will evolve at scale |
| **6. Risk** | EU AI Act text[^42], NIST AI RMF, GDPR, sector regulations[^3] | FSB systemic risk analysis[^24], IBM hallucination research[^43] | Incident databases, security breach records | Vendor security certifications [**MEDIUM — verify independently**] | Your specific data classification, threat model, regulatory context | Future regulatory interpretation |
| **7. Competitive Dynamics** | Public earnings calls, press releases, job postings | First/fast-follower research; BCG AI advantage study[^31] | LinkedIn hiring intelligence, product launch monitoring | Vendor competitive positioning claims [**LOW**] | Your actual competitive moat, customer stickiness | Competitor strategic intent |
| **8. Maturity/Timing** | Gartner Hype Cycle[^28][^29], academic benchmarks, production case studies | Technology adoption lifecycle theory, real options timing[^20] | Community adoption signals (GitHub stars, Stack Overflow trends) | Vendor roadmap claims [**VERY LOW — routinely wrong**] | Your organisation's change velocity | When technology will plateau/mature |
| **9. Org/People** | HR research, change management failure rates[^13] | Kotter, ADKAR, prosci frameworks | Industry norms for AI adoption workforce impact | Vendor training/support claims [**MEDIUM**] | Your culture, leadership alignment, incentive structures | Individual employee response |

### Critical Category (e) — Internal-Only: The Wall That External Evidence Cannot Cross

The following components **cannot be reliably assessed from any external source**. A tool that attempts to answer these from public data is producing false precision and should explicitly flag them as requiring internal input:

1. **Your actual current-state data quality, lineage, and governance maturity**
2. **The depth of your organization's change management capability and resistance profile**
3. **Your real competitive moat** — what is genuinely defensible vs. perceived differentiation
4. **Your leadership team's AI literacy and alignment** — what executives say in surveys ≠ what they'll fund
5. **Your specific system architecture and technical debt** — determines real integration cost
6. **Proprietary data volume and quality relative to use case requirements**
7. **Your actual negotiated vendor contract terms** — pricing and exit clauses vary enormously from list prices
8. **Risk tolerance and time horizon** — two companies facing identical decisions may rationally choose differently based on their balance sheet and competitive position
9. **Internal process interdependencies** — which workflows are upstream/downstream of the AI capability
10. **Culture, incentive structure, and informal power dynamics** around the impacted function

## Part 3 — Where the Internet & AI/LLMs Are Unreliable

### 3.1 Failure Mode Catalogue

| Failure Mode | Definition | Dimensions Most Distorted | Tool Signal Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Benchmark ≠ Your Workload** | Published LLM/AI benchmarks test narrow tasks under controlled conditions; benchmark performance should not be used as a reliable indicator of general cognitive capabilities[^44][^45] | Dim 1 (TCO), Dim 6 (Reliability) | 🔴 **"Benchmark does not predict your workload performance"** |
| **Vendor Marketing as Data** | Vendor-authored content on cost savings, ROI, ease of integration is systematically optimistic; exclude integration, maintenance, and exit costs[^46] | Dim 1 (TCO), Dim 4 (Integration), Dim 5 (Lock-in) | 🔴 **"Source is vendor-produced — apply deep discount"** |
| **Hype/Recency Cycle** | AI discourse is dominated by recent launches; Gartner confirms AI agents and multimodal AI at the peak of inflated expectations in 2025[^28][^29] | Dim 7 (Competitive), Dim 8 (Maturity/Timing) | 🟡 **"Signal is from hype cycle peak — check production evidence"** |
| **Survivorship & Selection Bias** | Case studies almost exclusively feature success stories; failure data is systematically underrepresented[^47][^48]; ~80–95% of enterprise AI projects fail to deliver expected results[^32] | Dim 7 (Competitive), Dim 9 (Org/People) | 🔴 **"Published cases overrepresent successes — seek failure evidence"** |
| **Stale Data / Knowledge Cutoffs** | LLMs have training cutoffs; AI market pricing, regulatory requirements, and vendor capabilities change monthly | Dim 1 (TCO), Dim 6 (Risk), Dim 8 (Maturity) | 🟡 **"Time-sensitive component — verify against live sources"** |
| **Hallucinated Specifics** | LLMs produce plausible but false specific claims (pricing, legal interpretations, technical specifications) with uniform confidence[^49][^23]; 47% of businesses made major decisions based on false AI output[^23] | All dimensions requiring specific numbers | 🔴 **"Verify all specific claims against primary sources"** |
| **False Precision** | External sources provide point estimates (e.g., "AI reduces costs by 35%") that are aggregates across contexts incomparable to the user's situation | Dim 1 (TCO), Dim 7 (Competitive) | 🟡 **"Point estimates hide wide variance — show ranges"** |
| **Missing Tacit/Contextual Knowledge** | External evidence cannot access internal data quality, team capability, culture, or process interdependencies (Category (e) above) | Dim 2 (Strategy), Dim 9 (Org), Dim 10 (Data), Dim 11 (Second-Order) | 🔴 **"Only you can answer this — requires internal assessment"** |
| **Base-Rate Neglect** | Leaders focus on the "inside view" (their specific situation) and ignore the base rate (how often similar decisions succeed)[^50][^51]; Kahneman documents this as a primary forecasting error | Dim 8 (Timing), Dim 9 (Org), Dim 1 (TCO) | 🟡 **"Ask: what is the base rate for this class of initiative?"** |
| **Publication Bias** | Academic and practitioner literature skews toward statistically significant, positive findings; null results are systematically absent[^47] | Dim 7 (Competitive), Dim 9 (Org/People) | 🟡 **"Evidence base may exclude negative outcomes"** |
| **Generalisation from n=1 Case Studies** | A compelling transformation story at one company tells you almost nothing about your situation; context is everything | Dim 9 (Org), Dim 1 (TCO), Dim 4 (Integration) | 🟡 **"Single case study — check for replication across contexts"** |
| **First-Mover Hype as Obligation** | Social media discourse systematically amplifies "move now or die" narratives[^52] without acknowledging the inverted-U relationship between adoption speed and advantage[^26] | Dim 8 (Timing/Maturity), Dim 12 (Option Value) | 🔴 **"Urgency claim — check for vendor/consultant incentive in source"** |
| **LLM Benchmark Gaming** | Benchmarks suffer from label errors, correlated prompts, and over-fitting; performance does not generalise to real-world tasks[^53][^44][^45] | Dim 6 (Reliability), Dim 1 (TCO) | 🔴 **"Model benchmark — does not predict your task performance"** |

### 3.2 Component-by-Component Reliability Verdict

| Decision Component | Web/LLM Reliability | Why | Recommended Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| TCO calculations | 🔴 LOW | Vendor marketing, missing integration/exit costs, no knowledge of your usage patterns | Internal finance model with range estimates |
| Strategic differentiation assessment | 🔴 LOW | Requires knowing your competitive moat (internal-only) | Internal strategic assessment |
| AI capability benchmarks | 🟡 MEDIUM with caveats | Published benchmarks exist but do not predict workload performance[^44] | Run your own eval on representative data sample |
| Switching cost estimates | 🟡 MEDIUM | Migration case studies exist; highly context-dependent[^5] | Estimate from architecture audit |
| Regulatory requirements | 🟢 HIGH | EU AI Act text is public; NIST AI RMF is public[^42] | Primary regulatory documents |
| Competitor adoption status | 🟡 MEDIUM | Job postings and earnings calls are public; intent is not | LinkedIn scraping + earnings call analysis |
| Technology maturity | 🟢 HIGH | Gartner, academic literature are public[^28] | Analyst reports + practitioner communities |
| Internal org readiness | 🔴 ZERO | Cannot be assessed externally | Internal survey + leadership interview |
| Data quality/readiness | 🔴 ZERO | Cannot be assessed externally | Internal data audit |
| Option value | 🟡 MEDIUM | Real options theory is well-developed; parameters need internal inputs[^30] | Parametric model with internal inputs |

## Part 4 — Confidence & Uncertainty Scoring

### 4.1 Survey of Established Methods

**GRADE Evidence Hierarchy (adapted for business decisions)**
Originally developed for clinical evidence, GRADE rates certainty across four levels based on study design, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias:[^54][^55][^56]
- **High:** Multiple high-quality, consistent, directly applicable studies; findings unlikely to change with new evidence
- **Moderate:** Findings probably reflect true effect; new evidence may change estimate
- **Low:** Confidence limited; new evidence likely to change estimate
- **Very Low:** Estimate is uncertain; any estimate of effect is very uncertain

For AI adoption decisions: RCT equivalents are rare; most evidence is observational (non-randomized), starting at Low certainty and adjustable up only for very strong associations or dose-response patterns.[^56]

**Superforecasting / Brier Score Calibration**
The Brier score measures mean squared distance between forecast probability and actual outcome: \(\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(f_i - o_i)^2\) where 0 = perfect and 0.25 = perpetual 50/50 guessing. Superforecasters in the Good Judgment Project achieved sustained Brier scores below 0.12, primarily by:[^57]
- Anchoring to base rates (outside view) before adjusting[^50]
- Expressing beliefs as explicit probabilities, not binary yes/no
- Updating incrementally as new evidence arrives (Bayesian updating)[^58]

**Bayesian Updating**
Posterior = (Likelihood × Prior) / Evidence. In business context: start with a base rate for the class of initiative (reference class), then update based on organisation-specific evidence. The discipline is in separating prior belief from new evidence and tracking both.[^59][^60]

**Rumsfeld / Known-Unknown-Unknowable Framework**
- **Known knowns:** Facts available to external evidence (regulatory requirements, benchmark costs)
- **Known unknowns:** Identified gaps requiring internal assessment (your data quality, org readiness)
- **Unknown unknowns:** Cannot be known in advance; build resilience and reversibility rather than trying to answer[^61][^62]
- **Unknown knowns:** Tacit knowledge inside the org that isn't being brought to bear on the decision[^62]

### 4.2 Recommended Per-Component Confidence Model

The following five-level model is simple, defensible, and visually communicable:

| Level | Label | Criteria | Visual Flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5** | Evidence-Backed | ≥3 independent high-quality external sources with direct applicability to component; internally verified | 🟢 Green |
| **4** | Well-Supported | 2–3 consistent external sources with moderate applicability; partial internal validation | 🔵 Blue |
| **3** | Directionally Supported | External evidence exists but applicability limited; or internal evidence only | 🟡 Yellow |
| **2** | Weak Signal | Single source or conflicting sources; context-specific evidence absent | 🟠 Orange |
| **1** | Internal Assessment Required | Cannot be assessed from external sources; requires specific internal input | 🔴 Red |
| **0** | Unknowable | Genuinely forecast-only; present scenario ranges, not point estimates | ⬛ Black / Range |

**Application rules:**
- Every component gets an explicit confidence level, not just a flag for low confidence
- Components at Level 1 or 0 must display: *"External sources cannot answer this. The following internal inputs are required: [specific list]"*
- Range estimates (10th–90th percentile) are required for any financial projection at Level ≤ 3
- Confidence should be expressed as a range with explicit uncertainty acknowledgement, not a single percentage
- Bayesian prior: for enterprise AI initiatives with no specific data, the base rate failure rate of ~80–95% should be the starting prior, not optimistic vendor case studies[^32][^13]

### 4.3 Visual Gap Flagging

For a decision clarity product:
- **Red block:** Explicitly internal; show form/prompt to gather the input needed
- **Yellow block with range bar:** External evidence exists but is context-dependent; show range, not point
- **"Benchmark ≠ Your Workload" badge:** Applied to any performance claim derived from published benchmarks[^44]
- **"Vendor Source" badge with trust haircut:** Applied to any data originating from a vendor
- **"Hype Cycle Peak" badge:** Applied to any technology in Peak of Inflated Expectations[^28]
- **"Survivorship Bias Risk" badge:** Applied to case study evidence without failure-rate context

## Part 5 — Decision-Science Scaffolding

### 5.1 Key Frameworks and AI-Adoption Application

| Framework | Core Idea | AI-Adoption Application | Failure Mode Without It |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reversibility / One-Way vs. Two-Way Doors** | Type 2 (reversible) decisions should be made fast with ~70% information; Type 1 (irreversible) demand full analysis[^16][^63] | Classify the AI adoption: Can you unwind a vendor commitment? Is the architecture portable? Vendor lock-in with proprietary fine-tuning data is typically a Type 1 decision in disguise | Treating a one-way door as reversible leads to hasty commitment to vendor lock-in |
| **Pre-Mortem Analysis** | Imagine it's 12 months out and the decision failed catastrophically; work backward to identify what went wrong[^17] | For AI adoption: "It's 18 months later. The AI initiative failed. What happened?" Common causes: data was not AI-ready, employees didn't adopt, vendor deprecated the API, integration cost 3× forecast | Leaders skip this; they anchor on the success case instead |
| **Load-Bearing Assumption Mapping** | Map the dependency tree of the plan; find assumptions that, if wrong, cause the entire plan to collapse[^64][^65][^66] | For AI build-vs-buy: What must be true? (a) Our data is clean enough. (b) We have integration capacity. (c) The vendor API is stable. Map which of these is *load-bearing and uncertain* — that intersection deserves explicit scrutiny | Leaders treat uncertain assumptions as settled; the plan collapses silently |
| **Reference-Class / Base-Rate Forecasting** | Anchor to the statistical distribution of similar past decisions (outside view) before the inside view[^50][^51][^67] | Before forecasting AI ROI, ask: What is the base rate for enterprise AI initiatives of this type delivering projected value? (~5–20% deliver full value in Year 1)[^32] | Planning fallacy; leaders over-estimate speed and under-estimate cost by default |
| **Disconfirming Evidence Seeking** | Actively seek evidence that the preferred option is wrong; assign devil's advocate explicitly[^68][^69] | Ask: "What would have to be true for the competing option to be correct?" For build: "What if we can't hire/retain AI engineers?" For buy: "What if vendor raises prices 10× after lock-in?" | Confirmation bias; leaders find the evidence they want to find |
| **Opportunity Cost Framing** | Every resource committed to this decision is unavailable for alternatives; the forgone option has real value[^6] | For AI build: the engineering team building this cannot build product features. For AI buy: the budget cannot be used for data infrastructure or talent. Make the trade-off explicit | Leaders evaluate the option in isolation, not relative to alternatives |
| **Decision vs. Outcome Quality** | A good decision can produce a bad outcome (bad luck); a bad decision can produce a good outcome (good luck)[^70][^71][^72] | Evaluate AI decisions on process quality — were load-bearing assumptions explicit? Were ranges used instead of point estimates? — not just whether the project succeeded | Leaders punish good-process/bad-outcome and reward bad-process/good-outcome; this degrades institutional decision quality over time |

## Part 6 — Edge Cases & Tricky Scenarios

### 6.1 Catalogue of Tricky Cases

| Edge Case | Why It's Tricky | Tool Response |
|---|---|---|
| **"Everyone is doing it" urgency** | Social proof is not evidence of suitability; first-mover advantage follows an inverted-U curve[^26]; vendor/consultant urgency narratives are incentivised[^52] | Flag source incentive; apply base-rate check on first-mover advantage claims |
| **Benchmark-based reliability claims** | Published benchmarks test narrow, controlled tasks; do not predict performance on your specific workload[^44][^73] | Mandatory: "This benchmark result does not predict your task performance. Require pilot evaluation on your data." |
| **ROI projections from vendor case studies** | Survivorship bias: only successful cases are published; failure rate ~80–95%[^32]; BCG revenue growth claims[^31] don't decompose causation from selection effects | Show failure rate base rate alongside any success case |
| **Regulatory compliance claims** | EU AI Act classification depends on *use case*, not tool[^21]; the same tool is minimal risk or high risk based on deployment context | Cannot be answered without knowing the specific use case and jurisdiction; surface regulatory checklist requiring internal input |
| **Data readiness self-assessment** | Leaders systematically over-estimate their data readiness; 57% of orgs struggle with AI-ready data[^34] | Require explicit data audit as gating question; tool should not proceed to economic analysis without data readiness confirmation |
| **"Our situation is unique" override** | Leaders use perceived uniqueness to dismiss base rates; Kahneman documents this as the core planning fallacy mechanism[^74][^50] | Always show the reference class distribution before the inside-view adjustment |
| **Timing decisions under rapid technology change** | AI model capabilities, costs, and ecosystems change quarterly; information is stale within months[^75] | Flag all timing-sensitive evidence with a date; weight recency heavily |
| **The "thin wrapper" vs. genuine build** | Building on top of a third-party API is not the same as building an AI capability; if the underlying model is deprecated or repriced, the wrapper loses its value | Explicitly classify: is this a sovereign AI build (fine-tuned on proprietary data, self-hosted) or an API wrapper? Different risk profiles |
| **AI makes the call** | Delegating operational decisions to AI changes accountability structures, creates attribution risk, and may violate regulatory requirements[^25][^42] | Require explicit human-in-the-loop / human-on-the-loop classification; surface EU AI Act obligations |
| **Culture as a blocking variable** | Technical and economic analysis can be perfect while the initiative fails due to culture and resistance[^11]; this is genuinely internal-only and cannot be externally assessed | Hard block: "Organizational readiness cannot be assessed without internal input. Before proceeding, complete the readiness checklist." |

### 6.2 Build-vs-Buy AI Capability: Fully Worked Decomposition

*Using a mid-sized enterprise considering whether to build or buy an AI-powered sales intelligence capability.*

***

**Decision stated:** "Should we build our own AI sales intelligence engine or buy a vendor solution?"

**Step 1 — Reframe as a real decision tree:**
The actual decision is *not* binary. It is:
- Buy (API wrapper over commodity LLM)
- Buy (purpose-built sales intelligence SaaS)
- Build (fine-tuned model on proprietary customer/CRM data)
- Build (agent framework on top of frontier API)
- Pilot first (two-way door option to preserve larger decision)
- Partner (co-develop with implementation partner)

***

**Step 2 — Decompose each dimension with evidence quality:**

| Dimension | Key Question | Evidence Quality | Source | Gap/Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TCO** | What does full 3-year TCO look like for each option? | 🟡 3 | Published TCO frameworks[^2]; missing your usage volume and ops cost | 🔴 Internal: What is our expected query volume? Engineering capacity for build? |
| **Strategic Fit** | Is sales intelligence a core differentiator or commodity? | 🔴 1 | Cannot determine without knowing your actual competitive moat | 🔴 Internal only |
| **Capability/Skills** | Do we have ML engineers and sales AI expertise? | 🔴 1 | LinkedIn market data exists; your internal skills cannot be assessed externally | 🔴 Internal: Conduct skills audit |
| **Switching/Integration** | How deeply will this integrate with our CRM and data stack? | 🟡 3 | Integration cost benchmarks exist[^5]; your architecture is unknown | 🔴 Internal: Architecture review required |
| **Reversibility** | If we pick a vendor, can we leave in 24 months? | 🟡 3 | 42% of migrations go smoothly[^18]; your contract terms unknown | 🔴 Internal: Legal review of contract; require data portability clause |
| **Risk** | What are the compliance implications for customer data? | 🟢 5 | EU AI Act, GDPR, CCPA requirements are public[^42] | 🔴 Internal: How is your customer data classified? |
| **Competitive Dynamics** | Are competitors deploying this capability? | 🟡 3 | LinkedIn hiring signals, product announcements are public | 🟡 Research job boards and product pages |
| **Maturity/Timing** | Is sales AI technology mature enough for production? | 🟢 4 | Gartner positions sales AI on Slope of Enlightenment[^28] | Flag: agentic components still at Peak of Inflated Expectations[^29] |
| **Org/People** | Will the sales team adopt this? | 🔴 1 | Base rate: 83% of AI adoptions fail organizationally[^13] | 🔴 Internal: Sales leadership alignment check required |
| **Data Readiness** | Is our CRM data clean enough to fine-tune on? | 🔴 0 | Cannot assess from external sources | 🔴 Internal: Data audit before economic analysis |
| **Second-Order Effects** | What happens to sales process workflows and accountability? | 🟡 2 | Systemic risk literature applies[^25] | 🔴 Internal: Map process dependencies |
| **Option Value** | What is the value of a pilot first vs. full commitment? | 🟡 3 | Real options theory well-developed[^30]; parameters need internal inputs | Model: cost of pilot vs. value of information gained |

***

**Step 3 — Load-Bearing Assumptions (what must be true for "build" to be the right answer):**

1. ✳️ We have (or can hire within 3 months) ML engineers with production deployment experience — **uncertain and load-bearing**
2. ✳️ Our CRM data is clean, consistently structured, and sufficient in volume — **uncertain and load-bearing**
3. ✳️ The capability represents a genuine competitive differentiator (not table stakes) — **unknown without internal strategy review**
4. ✳️ The 10-20M token/day crossover point where self-hosting is cheaper than APIs will be reached within 18 months — **check against realistic usage forecast**
5. ✳️ The engineering team has capacity that won't be diverted by other product priorities — **highly variable and internal-only**

***

**Step 4 — Pre-Mortem (18 months out, the build failed — what happened?):**

Most common causes (from base-rate data):
- Data was not AI-ready; 6 months lost on data cleanup before any ML work started
- ML engineer hired but left after 8 months; no knowledge transfer
- CRM integration took 3× estimated time; sales team used workaround spreadsheets instead
- Model performance in production was significantly below benchmark performance on test set[^44]
- Sales leadership wasn't consulted during design; output not aligned to their actual workflow

***

**Step 5 — Reversibility classification:**

- Buy (SaaS): **Two-way door IF** contract includes data portability, <6-month exit notice, no exclusive training data clauses
- Build on proprietary fine-tuning: **One-way door tendency** — proprietary training data, custom deployment pipeline, organizational process built around it
- Pilot first: **Two-way door** — explicitly structured for reversibility; maximum option preservation

***

**Step 6 — Honest output the tool should surface:**

> *"Based on external evidence, we can assess: regulatory requirements (HIGH confidence), technology maturity (HIGH confidence), and switching-cost ranges (MEDIUM confidence). We cannot assess from external sources: your data readiness, internal engineering capacity, competitive differentiation, or sales team adoption likelihood. These four components are load-bearing assumptions. The decision should not proceed to financial modeling until they are explicitly evaluated internally. The base rate for enterprise AI build initiatives delivering projected value in Year 1 is approximately 5–20%. Apply this as your prior before adjusting for your specific context."*[^32]

***

## Appendix — Quick Reference: Decision Health Checklist

Before treating any external evidence as decision-relevant, verify:

- [ ] Is the source vendor-produced? (Apply deep discount)
- [ ] Does performance data come from a benchmark? (Flag: benchmark ≠ your workload)[^44]
- [ ] Is the case study from a company with your org size, sector, and data maturity?
- [ ] Has failure rate data been presented alongside success cases?[^47][^48]
- [ ] Has the reference class base rate been established before the inside view?[^50]
- [ ] Have load-bearing assumptions been made explicit and tested?[^64]
- [ ] Has a pre-mortem been run on the preferred option?[^17]
- [ ] Is the decision reversibility correctly classified (one-way vs. two-way door)?[^16]
- [ ] Are regulatory requirements assessed against actual use case, not tool label?[^21]
- [ ] Have all internal-only components been flagged and routed to human assessment?

***

*All external evidence citations are inline. Components marked (e) or (f) in Part 2 cannot be sourced externally and must not be answered by an AI tool without explicit internal input. Any tool that generates point-estimate answers for these components is producing false precision and should be redesigned.*
