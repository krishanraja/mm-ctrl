# CTRL Experience Compass — artifact build prompt

> Paste everything below the line into a new conversation at claude.ai to build the data-collection artifact. The exported Markdown comes back into the CTRL Upgrades project and gets mapped into `_STATE.md` §6A, then synthesized into the big-picture experience design.

---

Build me a single-file interactive React artifact called **"CTRL Experience Compass."**

**PURPOSE:** It walks me (the founder) through ~22 "rank these scenarios" questions to design the big-picture EXPERIENCE of my product, CTRL (an AI-native decision/leadership app for time-poor CEOs). For each question I rank the options from best to worst and explain WHY. **The WHY is the most important data.** It must be fast, frictionless, impossible to lose input, and export everything cleanly at the end.

**CRITICAL UX REQUIREMENTS — these fix real pain, honor them exactly:**
1. **One question per screen.** Calm, large, readable. No walls of text.
2. **Ranking = a vertical list of the options that I order from BEST (top) to WORST (bottom).** Support BOTH drag-and-drop AND up/down arrow buttons on every row (the arrows must always work even if drag is finicky on mobile). Show a 1..N rank badge on each row. Ranking must never be a single irreversible click — I can always reorder.
3. **Reasoning capture is mandatory and prominent:** a "Why this order? (What makes your #1 great, and your last one wrong?)" textarea sits directly under the ranking. I cannot advance to the next question until it has text — BUT include a small, low-emphasis "skip reasoning" link that records "(skipped)" if I truly choose to. Also give each option an optional "+ note" affordance for a one-line reaction to that specific option.
4. **Optional intensity:** a "How strongly do you feel about this? (1–5)" slider per question, default 3.
5. **Autosave EVERYTHING to localStorage on every change.** On reload, restore all answers and jump me to the first unanswered question. Show a subtle "Saved ✓" indicator. Losing my input is the worst possible failure — guard against it.
6. **Progress:** a progress bar + "Q x of 22". A **Back** button to revise any earlier answer without losing later ones. Let me jump to any question via a small list/menu.
7. **Export — in the header at all times AND on a final summary screen. The export MUST be fully self-describing, because whoever reads it later has ZERO prior context about this exercise or the app.**
   - **"Copy as Markdown"** (clipboard) → a document that begins with a header block: the title "CTRL Experience Compass — Results"; a one-line description ("A directional ranking interrogation to design the big-picture experience of CTRL, an AI-native decision/leadership app for time-poor CEOs. Each scenario was ranked best→worst, with the reasoning being the key data."); the date; and "Answered: X / 22". Then, per question: the question number + theme, the SCENE text, my RANKING as a numbered list 1→N using each option's FULL label **and** full text (never just letters), my WHY verbatim, any per-option notes, and intensity (1–5). End with the final "Anything else" free-text. It must stand completely on its own without the app.
   - **"Copy as JSON"** / **"Download .json"** → a complete object: `meta` { tool, version, exportedAt, answeredCount } ; `finalThoughts` ; and `answers` keyed by question id, each with { theme, scene, ranked: [ {rank, key, label, text, note} ], why, intensity }. Include every option's full text.
   - **"Download .md"**.
   - The Markdown is what I send to my collaborator (who is mid-project on this) AND what I might read cold months later — so make it clean, complete, and unambiguous.
8. **A final free-text box:** "Anything else about the big-picture experience you want to capture?" — included in the export.

**DESIGN:** Dark theme (near-black background, e.g. zinc-950), emerald accent `#00D9B6`, generous whitespace, large type, subtle transitions (use framer-motion if available, otherwise CSS). Mobile-first and genuinely pleasant to use one-handed — it should feel like a premium product, because ranking + reasoning should feel like a fun design exercise, not a form.

**TECH:** Single file, React + Tailwind, **client-side only, no network calls, no backend, localStorage only.** Do NOT change the question content below — render it verbatim. Default to robustness over cleverness; make sure drag, arrows, autosave, and export all actually work.

Use exactly this content:
