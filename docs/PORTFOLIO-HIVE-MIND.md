(The bold **Status:** line below is the implementation status of the work described, not the class of this document.)

**Status:** COMPLETE + LIVE in production (2026-06-30). Brand cohesion, the one-pool/three-surfaces news engine, the consent-gated handoff, the cohort-anxiety curation prior, the aggregate engine, and the public Cohort Signal widget are all shipped; the enrichment-convergence unit is closed to an evidenced keep-separate decision (see below). This is the canonical record of the cross-product effort spanning the three sibling repos: **Make Your Mind Up** (`makeyourmindup`), **Mindmaker** (`mindmaker`), and **CTRL** (`mm-ctrl`). They share ONE Supabase project (`bkyuxvschuwngtcdhsyg`).

## North star: one operator, three rooms, one brain
The three products are not three brands; they are three rooms a leader walks through by readiness, over one shared intelligence:
- **Make Your Mind Up** = the front door (anonymous provocation; captures **anxiety** - q5 "the decision you keep not making", the entry door, the modality sliders).
- **Mindmaker** = the consulting room (high-touch advisory; captures **intent** - the diagnosed nervous decision + company dossier).
- **CTRL** = the cockpit (retained daily instrument; captures **behavior** - reactions, decisions, the compounding brain).

The anti-vanilla principle: **unify the body, never the personality.**
1. **Shared body (compute once, all drink):** the corroborated news pool, the Artificial-Analysis model index, the enrichment graph, the voice spec.
2. **Sovereign personality (never homogenized):** MYMU provokes, Mindmaker opines (cynical SIGNAL/NOISE/TAKE), CTRL personalizes. Each renders the shared body through its own lens.
3. **Cross-ladder learning (the hive mind):** each surface's unique signal sharpens the others.

## Brand cohesion (LIVE)
One portfolio signature: **emerald `#00D9B6` = `171 100% 43%`** (was per-product mint/emerald/none). Migrated as a SYSTEM with `emerald-deep #06746d` for AA text-on-light. Canonical contract: `mm-ctrl/standards/design-tokens.css` (the "MindmakerOS" token contract siblings mirror). Each product keeps its soul: CTRL dark cockpit, Mindmaker light room, MYMU rose/ember serif front door + the shared Mindmaker icon as the family endorsement. WCAG proof: `mindmaker/prototypes/brand-emerald-proof.{html,md}`.

## The hive-mind wires (what is LIVE)

### One pool, three surfaces (Hive A / A')
CTRL's corroborated `live_headlines_cache` (built by `live-headlines`, the crown-jewel pipeline) is now the portfolio's shared pool:
- **MYMU** `send-result-email` + `_shared/reads.ts` (`pickThreeReads`): the long-promised "three things to read" are delivered from the pool, ranked against the leader's q5.
- **Mindmaker** `get-ai-news` Plan A0: reads the pool first, maps the 9 lanes to Krish's editorial taxonomy; `/signal` (`Brief.tsx` + `useLiveBrief`) renders the corroborated WATCH/CALL cards with a "+N sources" chip (corroboration UNDER opinion) and KEEPS Krish's sovereign SKIP/TAKE editorial interleaved.
- **CTRL** Home/Briefing read it directly (pre-existing).

### Consent-gated warm handoff (Hive B)
The funnel DNA travels the ladder, consent-gated, raw q5 never leaving:
- **Produce:** MYMU fork offers an opt-in -> `track-fork` mints a `portfolio_handoff` row carrying only the CATEGORISED signal (an anxiety LANE from q5 via the shared ranker, the entry door, q2/q4, company domain, archetype) + returns a token appended as `?h=<token>`.
- **Store:** `portfolio_handoff` table (RLS on, service-role only, 7-day TTL; migration `makeyourmindup/.../20260629000000_portfolio_handoff.sql`).
- **Resolve:** CTRL `resolve-handoff` returns the signal + marks consumed.
- **Consume:** CTRL `HandoffWelcome` (on both Home views, token captured in `Landing.tsx`) stages one honest "here's what I think is on your mind - confirm?" and on yes seeds ONE `user_memory` blocker fact (`verification_status: 'inferred'`).

### The aggregate "State of the AI-Native Leader" + the curation prior (Hive D, LIVE)
`portfolio-pulse`: categorizes recent MYMU q5 answers into lanes server-side and returns ONLY the anonymized distribution (counts + shares, no PII, no raw q5). The cross-surface signal of what the cohort is grappling with.

The prior is now WIRED into CTRL's news re-rank (the load-bearing payoff): `usePortfolioPulse` reads the aggregate (top 2 lanes, only when total volume >= 8) and feeds it to `newsPriority.ts` as a `zeitgeistLift` term (`ZEITGEIST_LIFT = 0.5`) - a deliberately GENTLE tie-breaker, far below the leader's own boost/bias/fit. It only breaks ties among similar-importance cards for a leader who has NOT tuned their own feed (the generic/cold path); an empty cohort signal is an exact identity (self-disables on thin data, never overrides a personal choice). So the front-door anxiety bends the cockpit's curation prior without homogenizing the feed.

The public face (D-expose) is now LIVE too: Mindmaker `/signal` renders the **Cohort Signal** (`src/components/PortfolioPulse.tsx`) - "what leaders are actually wrestling with", the nine lanes as anonymised share bars, fed by `portfolio-pulse`. Volume-guarded (self-hides below 12 leaders so a thin room never reads as weakness) and prerender-safe (renders null during SSG). No PII reaches the client - counts + shares only.

## Privacy model (decisions, honored)
- Anonymized **aggregate** signal flows freely (no PII): `portfolio-pulse`.
- **Per-person** signal crosses only on explicit consent at the fork: the handoff.
- The **raw q5 and any transcript NEVER travel** - only the categorized lane/shape does. Categorization always happens server-side.

## What remains (refinements on a live foundation)
- **Nothing load-bearing.** Both open items are closed: D (engine + curation prior + public widget) is LIVE; C is closed to an evidenced keep-separate decision (below). The only follow-on is naturally-occurring: the Cohort Signal widget lights up once >=12 leaders have answered q5 (it self-hides until then), and the enrichment providers should be re-reviewed only if their richness needs ever converge.
- **C - one enrichment service (CLOSED: providers stay separate, evidenced):** the structural map showed the two waterfalls are NOT near-identical duplicates - MYMU `enrich-profile` resolves a *person* (flat `ResolvedPerson`), Mindmaker `enrich-company` resolves a *company* (nested `Dossier` with a load-bearing `scale.*` privacy-routing layer + voice synthesis). They share only the four pure provider calls (PDL/Brandfetch/BuiltWith/Tranco) + the web-signals providers. A blind merge would vanilla away each one's soul and risk two live conversion functions unverifiably. The canonical shared-core contract (neutral `PartialEnrichment` body, sovereign orchestrators/output/voice) + a safe incremental migration path are specified in `docs/ENRICHMENT-CONVERGENCE.md`. The body converges; the personality stays.

## Deploy note
Edge functions in this environment deploy via the Supabase Management API multipart bundler (`POST /v1/projects/<ref>/functions/deploy?slug=<slug>` with `-F metadata=...` + `-F file=@...;filename=...`); the CLI is proxy-blocked and the MCP deploy is permission-gated here.
