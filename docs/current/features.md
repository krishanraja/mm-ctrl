# CTRL features

Status: Current
Owner: Mindmaker
Last verified: 2026-09-05 against live Supabase containment readback, the earlier Vercel frontend baseline, `src/router.tsx`, and plan constants

This inventory distinguishes the user-facing product from supporting and nested harnesses. It does not treat every route or Edge Function as a feature.

## Primary capabilities

| Capability | What the user gets | Main route | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Today and First Lens | A small, premium set of ranked AI signals and one useful next move | `/dashboard` | Free |
| Daily briefing | A short personal read and listen, with grounded talk-back | `/briefing` and Today control | Free |
| Decide | An AI-native reframe, verified claims, tensions, and advice | `/decision` | 3 per month free; unlimited Pro |
| Blind Spot | One private mechanism-level read, exact evidence anchors, a small experiment, and bounded advisor talk-back | `/blind-spot` | Free |
| Memory | Structured, corrected, portable context through Graph, All facts, and Library | `/memory` | Free |
| Settings and privacy | Delivery, interests, memory, transcript, data, and account controls | `/settings`, `/compliance`, `/profile` | Free |

Entitlements are defined by [`src/constants/planMatrix.ts`](../../src/constants/planMatrix.ts). Price is defined by [`supabase/functions/_shared/edge-pricing.ts`](../../supabase/functions/_shared/edge-pricing.ts).

## Supporting capabilities

- Public onboarding currently yields a deterministic local future-memory result and can continue to ordinary signup.
- Company recognition, server-generated onboarding results, persisted handoff, result email, and new no-login briefing subscription are temporarily unavailable under trust containment.
- Nine AI-native news categories with stable visual motifs.
- Shared-source clustering, corroboration, category balance, and role-aware ranking.
- One feed-tuning control reused by Today and Settings.
- Email and audio delivery without a dashboard visit.
- Existing briefing surfaces remain in the product; public onboarding cannot currently create a new no-login briefing subscription.
- Context export for use in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, and Claude Code.
- Decision watch, outcomes, track record, and map.
- Memory correction lineage, verification, encryption, expiry settings, and export.
- Privacy, retention, import, and data export are configured from the single Settings surface; Memory does not duplicate those controls.
- Blind Spot evidence qualification, rejection suppression, one active experiment, and a due briefing check-in.
- Blind Spot burn: a confirmed pattern, its evidence links, and its experiment can be deleted outright. Only a content-free anchor fingerprint is retained, so the same read is not regenerated the next day, and the surface says exactly that.
- Off the record: a session-scoped mode that writes nothing durable. No memory, no evidence, no influence on the next briefing. It is not persisted, so it resets on reload, and the product states plainly when a session saved nothing.
- Third-party minimisation at the Memory boundary. A person named next to a role is stored as the role; a fact whose subject is another person is not stored at all.
- Retention enforcement on a daily schedule, applying the 30-day, 90-day, or indefinite window chosen in Settings.
- Billing, account deletion including subscription cancellation, consent, and compliance controls.
- Loading and recovery paths exist broadly. The honest inline morning-brief failure state is committed on the containment branch and is not yet live.

## Public surfaces

These are static pages served ahead of the SPA by rewrites in `vercel.json`, not React routes.

| Surface | Path | Job |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing | `/pricing` | The two tiers and what each includes |
| Questions | `/faq` | Tier 1 answers to what CTRL is, who it is for, and where a leader's thinking lives |
| Security and privacy | `/trust` | The full posture: what is in place, in progress, and not done |

## Edge Pro

Edge Pro deepens decision support. It adds unlimited decision weighs, multi-model cross-examination, decision watch, generated artifacts, live MCP access, and artifact email delivery. Memory, Blind Spot, and the daily briefing remain useful on Free.

## Nested harnesses

Nested harnesses support a specific job or portability outcome. They must not become competing top-level products.

| Harness | Route or boundary | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Context export | `/context` | Portable context copy or file |
| Decision map and track record | `/decision-map`, `/track-record` | Deeper evidence and outcome views |
| Goals and enrichment | `/goals`, `/enrich` | Supporting context and follow-through |
| Check, review, proposals | `/sort`, `/review`, `/proposals` | Observation and learning chain, URL-reachable but not primary navigation |
| Agents | `/agents` | Public MCP/context explanation |
| Public demo | `/try` | Pre-login shaped example |
| Upgrade | `/upgrade`; public `/pricing` rewrite | Plan comparison and checkout entry |
| Trust and security | Public `/trust` rewrite | Honest security posture: controls in place, in progress, and absent |
| Preview | `/preview` | Unlinked deterministic QA fixtures |
| Skill and MCP generation | Backend functions and exports | Portability substrate only |

## Route inventory

### Public

`/`, `/auth`, `/auth/callback`, `/preview`, `/agents`, `/try`, `/download`, and `/upgrade`.

`/build` redirects to `/`. `/download` is feature-flagged. Vercel rewrites public `/pricing` to the static pricing page and public `/trust` to the static trust page.

### Authenticated

`/dashboard`, `/memory`, `/context`, `/briefing`, `/decision`, `/blind-spot`, `/goals`, `/track-record`, `/decision-map`, `/enrich`, `/sort`, `/review`, `/proposals`, `/settings`, `/compliance`, and `/profile`.

### Legacy redirects

`/today`, `/pulse`, `/voice`, and `/diagnostic` redirect to `/dashboard`. `/think` redirects to `/dashboard?view=edge`. Vercel permanently redirects `/kit` and `/kit/*` to `/try`.

## Explicitly retired or demoted

- The lesson-kit collection and `/kit` product flow.
- Automator or Skill Builder as a primary leadership-development destination.
- Multiple dashboard variants or a second onboarding interview.
- Context Export as a primary navigation tab.
- Generic business advice that has no AI-native reframe.
- Duplicate tuning controls or separate briefing feeds.

Historical code may remain where a nested harness still uses it. Presence in source does not promote it back into the product.

## Feature acceptance

A feature is complete only when the route and auth boundary are correct, the empty and failure states are honest, data persists idempotently, desktop and mobile fit, keyboard and touch paths work, the relevant provider or integration is actively exercised, and this inventory still describes the product without qualification.
