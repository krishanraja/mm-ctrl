# CTRL current documentation

Status: Current
Owner: Mindmaker
Last verified: 2026-09-05 for emergency public-entry availability against production containment release `trust-containment-2026-09-05`, its production database readback, and branch commit `7c48e6fc3f33fff0baa3ce0029f95e38381da258` for the pending recovery copy. The remaining documentation set was last verified on 2026-08-20 against production application baseline `b5770194b4646302f47e36655e389f7ec2eb43f8` and live Supabase readback

This directory is the shortest reliable path from product intent to safe operation. It describes CTRL as it exists now. Git history and the dated project records explain how it arrived here.

## Emergency containment snapshot

Production trust containment is active as of 2026-09-05. The public intake currently provides its questions, a deterministic result rendered in the browser, and the ordinary CTRL signup route. Company recognition and enrichment, the server-generated result, persisted portfolio handoff, result email, and creation or reactivation of a no-login briefing subscription are temporarily unavailable.

The containment branch includes inline recovery copy that explains the briefing pause and keeps signup available. That frontend change is branch-only until the repository owner merges it and the Vercel deployment is verified. Use [`supabase/containment/manifest.json`](../../supabase/containment/manifest.json) for the intended containment action and [`supabase/containment/release-lock.production.json`](../../supabase/containment/release-lock.production.json) for production readback. Product and commercial documents preserve the intended restoration contract while labelling it separately from current availability.

| Job | Start here | Then read |
|---|---|---|
| Understand the product | [Product](./product.md) | [Features](./features.md) |
| Market or sell CTRL | [Commercial authority](./commercial.md) | [Marketing and sales instructions](../agent-instructions/marketing-sales.md) |
| Change the interface | [Product](./product.md) | [Architecture](./architecture.md), [frontend instructions](../agent-instructions/frontend.md) |
| Resume material interface work | [Design delivery state](./design-state.md) | [Product](./product.md), [Architecture](./architecture.md) |
| Change data or AI behavior | [Architecture](./architecture.md) | [Supabase instructions](../agent-instructions/supabase.md), [release guide](../../project-documentation/REPLICATION_GUIDE.md) |
| Operate or release CTRL | [Release state](./release-state.md) | [Release guide](../../project-documentation/REPLICATION_GUIDE.md) |
| Maintain documentation | [Documentation standards](./documentation-standards.md) | `npm run docs:check` |
| Work as a coding agent | [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) | [Agent instructions](../agent-instructions/README.md) |

## Authority order

When two sources disagree, use this order:

1. Executable code, database readback, deployment readback, and `src/router.tsx`.
2. `public/.well-known/product.json` for machine-readable product and pricing truth.
3. This `docs/current/` set. [Commercial authority](./commercial.md) owns human-readable marketing and sales claims.
4. [`project-documentation/DECISIONS_LOG.md`](../../project-documentation/DECISIONS_LOG.md) for accepted decisions.
5. Subsystem references, compliance records, and runbooks.
6. Dated delivery notes, prototypes, roadmaps, and Git history.

Code wins when prose drifts. Correct the prose in the same change.

## Current documents

- [Product](./product.md): user, promise, value loop, experience laws, and non-goals.
- [Commercial authority](./commercial.md): buyer, offer, proof, message, objections, claims, and freshness boundaries.
- [Architecture](./architecture.md): system boundaries, data flows, trust boundaries, providers, and deployment shape.
- [Features](./features.md): live, supporting, nested, and retired capabilities.
- [Release state](./release-state.md): exact production baseline, verification evidence, and known debt.
- [Documentation standards](./documentation-standards.md): ownership, freshness, history, and automated drift rules.
- [Design delivery state](./design-state.md): the current material surface, approval gate, artifact revision, and exactly one next action.

## Reference, not competing truth

Each of these is authoritative inside its own named boundary and nowhere else. Every reference document in the repository is listed here; if a file is not in this list and not marked Historical, that is a documentation defect.

- [`docs/CURATION-SYSTEM-SPEC.md`](../CURATION-SYSTEM-SPEC.md) is the detailed curation implementation reference.
- [`docs/PORTFOLIO-HIVE-MIND.md`](../PORTFOLIO-HIVE-MIND.md) records the three-product portfolio that shares one Supabase project, and is the deeper background to the shared-project boundary in [architecture](./architecture.md#the-supabase-project-is-shared).
- [`docs/ENRICHMENT-CONVERGENCE.md`](../ENRICHMENT-CONVERGENCE.md) records why the two enrichment waterfalls were deliberately kept separate.
- [`docs/HARNESS-CHAIN-STATE.md`](../HARNESS-CHAIN-STATE.md) is what is live, deferred, and open in the harness chain, with [`docs/PHASE-0.5-HANDRUN.md`](../PHASE-0.5-HANDRUN.md) as its by-hand protocol.
- [`docs/AGENTIC_UI_TESTING.md`](../AGENTIC_UI_TESTING.md) is the agent-driven UI testing approach.
- [`docs/UX-PRINCIPLES.md`](../UX-PRINCIPLES.md) is the reasoning behind the experience laws that [product](./product.md) owns.
- [`docs/VOICE_PROFILE.md`](../VOICE_PROFILE.md) is the dormant voice-profile subsystem: capture removed, read path live.
- [`project-documentation/NORTH_STAR.md`](../../project-documentation/NORTH_STAR.md) is the flywheel metric and its instrumentation.
- [`docs/BRIEFING_GENERATION_HISTORY.md`](../BRIEFING_GENERATION_HISTORY.md) is the running log of briefing-generation failure modes. Read it before changing that path.
- [`project-documentation/REPLICATION_GUIDE.md`](../../project-documentation/REPLICATION_GUIDE.md) is the release and recovery runbook.
- [`project-documentation/compliance/`](../../project-documentation/compliance/README.md) contains legal and control records. Their status labels are authoritative for compliance claims.
- [`project-documentation/HISTORY.md`](../../project-documentation/HISTORY.md) and [`APP-DELIVERY-STATE.md`](../../project-documentation/APP-DELIVERY-STATE.md) are historical records, not current instructions.
- [`docs/history/`](../history/) is the single archive location for superseded documents.

## Freshness rule

Update a current document when its product contract, route, data boundary, provider path, release baseline, or operating command changes. `npm run docs:check` blocks broken links, stale repository counts, duplicate decision IDs, oversized root agent instructions, and known contradictory claims.
