## Agent Skill Builder: Voice-to-Skill Pipeline (Edge Pro)

### Overview

Turns a repetitive leader workflow into a downloadable, **agentskills.io-compliant** Agent Skill the leader drops into `~/.claude/skills/`. The leader describes (voice or text) one thing they do at least weekly. CTRL extracts the trigger, the steps, the format constraints, and packages it as a ZIP that auto-triggers in Claude Code / Claude.ai / Cursor whenever their language matches.

This is the third surface on the Context Export page (`/context`). Two minutes describing a Monday-morning ritual is enough to generate a permanent piece of agent infrastructure the leader owns.

**Pages / surfaces:**
- `/context` (Step 1) — `SkillExportCard` promoted above the Custom Voice card, gated behind Edge Pro
- Edge view (`/dashboard?view=edge`) — `AutomatePainCard` chip row of declared blockers + active decisions
- Memory Web blocker cards — zap button on each blocker
- Briefing — zap button on every `decision_trigger` segment (v1 + v2)

All four entry points hand the user's already-declared pain to the Skill Builder via a `SkillSeed`, navigate to `/context`, and auto-open `SkillCaptureSheet` pre-anchored. The LLM grounds extraction in the leader's actual words instead of inventing an abstract trigger.

### The Pipeline (shipped May 2026)

Seven stages, all running inside `generate-skill-export/index.ts`:

| Stage | What it does | Model / Tool |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Edge Pro gate | Verify `edge_subscriptions.status` is `active` or `past_due` | Postgres |
| 2. Context build | Pull Memory Web facts + edge profile strengths/weaknesses for grounding | `buildMemoryContext` (3000 token budget) |
| 3. Triage (Three Honest Tests) | Decide whether the input is really a skill, a Memory Web fact, a Custom Instruction, or a Saved Style. Triage failures route the input to the right surface and are still logged in `skill_exports` for analytics. | OpenAI JSON mode (gpt-4o), temperature 0.3 |
| 4. Extraction | Generate skill name, description, body, references, test prompts, gotchas, archetype | OpenAI JSON mode |
| 5. Quality gate | Validate 5+ trigger phrases, push language, third-person voice, body under 500 lines, imperative voice, required sections, no bare MUST/NEVER, valid name format | `runQualityGate` (deterministic) |
| 6. ZIP assembly | Build the agentskills.io standard bundle: single root folder, `SKILL.md` + `references/` + `01-test-prompts.txt` + `02-maintenance-card.txt` + `03-install-guide.txt` | `buildSkillZip` (Deno + JSZip) |
| 7. Persist | Insert into `skill_exports` (one row per attempt, including failed triage), return base64 ZIP inline | Supabase service role |

The Three Honest Tests triage is the value-prop differentiator: when a leader describes a one-time fact ("I worked at Microsoft in 2010"), CTRL routes that to Memory Web rather than generating a useless skill. When they describe a tone preference ("I always write in plain English"), it routes to Custom Instructions. Skills only get generated when the input is a repeatable, triggerable workflow.

### Skill Archetypes

Every generated skill is tagged with one of five archetypes (used for analytics and for tuning future routing):

- **decision-framework** — recurring decision templates (e.g. RFP triage, hire/no-hire)
- **voice-lock** — exec writing patterns that must hold across many outputs (e.g. board update voice)
- **reporting-engine** — periodic structured reports (e.g. weekly hiring sync, investor update)
- **tool-integration** — workflows that bridge external systems
- **getting-started** — onboarding / first-touch skills

### Pain-Anchored Entry Points

Skill creation is a reflex on the page where the pain shows up, not a standalone trip to `/context`:

| Entry point | Component | Seed kind |
|---|---|---|
| Edge view chip row | `AutomatePainCard` | `blocker` or `decision` |
| Memory Web blocker card | Zap button on `MemoryItemCard` | `blocker` |
| Briefing decision-trigger segment | Zap button on `BriefingCard` and `SegmentCard` | `briefing_segment` |
| Curated examples (cold-start fallback) | `SkillCaptureSheet` chips | `example` |

The seed flows: entry point → `useNavigate('/context', { state: { skillSeed } })` → `ContextExport` page detects and auto-opens `SkillCaptureSheet` with a pre-filled scaffold. The user only adds the steps they follow today; the leading pain is already there.

### The SkillCaptureSheet (mobile bottom sheet / desktop dialog)

- Voice mode (default when no seed): up to 5 minutes of recording, OpenAI Whisper transcript, optional review/edit before submit
- Text mode (default when arriving with a seed): pre-filled scaffold built from the seed text
- Pain picker chip row when no seed is provided (pulls top 5 from `useUserPains`)
- Curated example chips fallback when the leader has no declared pains yet (Monday board update, Weekly hiring sync, RFP triage, Investor update)
- 20-character minimum on the description

### The SkillPreviewSheet

- Skill description and archetype
- Big Download CTA (decodes the base64 ZIP into a Blob in-browser)
- Quality gate checklist (passed / total, per-check detail)
- Test prompts with copy buttons (the leader pastes these into Claude to verify the skill triggers)
- Install guide accordion: Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills/`), Claude.ai (uploaded skills), Cursor

### Triage Routing

When the triage gate decides the input isn't a skill, the response is:

```
{ triage: { passed: false, result: "memory_fact" | "custom_instruction" | "saved_style", reasoning: "..." } }
```

The UI surfaces the routing decision so the leader knows exactly what to do with their input. No skill is generated. The attempt is still logged in `skill_exports` so we can learn from the misses without re-running the LLM.

### Data Architecture

**Table** (`20260508000000_create_skill_exports.sql`):

```
skill_exports
├── id (PK, uuid)
├── user_id (FK auth.users, ON DELETE CASCADE)
├── skill_name (TEXT)
├── description (TEXT)
├── transcript (TEXT) — original input, kept for analytics
├── triage_result (TEXT: 'skill' | 'custom_instruction' | 'memory_fact' | 'saved_style' | 'failed')
├── body_content (TEXT, null on failed triage)
├── references_json (JSONB)
├── test_prompts (TEXT[])
├── quality_gate (JSONB) — full checklist result
├── archetype (TEXT) — one of the 5 archetypes above
├── version (INT) — supports skill iteration
├── zip_path (TEXT) — null today; reserved for future Storage upload + shareable links
└── created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

RLS: owner-read, owner-insert. Indexed on `user_id` and `created_at DESC`.

**Edge Function:**
- `generate-skill-export` — the whole pipeline. Edge Pro gated (`active` or `past_due` grace). 4 internal files: `index.ts`, `prompt.ts` (system + user prompts encoding the triage rules + extraction rules), `quality-gate.ts` (deterministic validator), `zip.ts` (agentskills.io packager).

**Hooks:**
- `useSkillExport` — wraps the edge function. Manages full lifecycle: call, parse, decode the base64 ZIP into a downloadable Blob.
- `useUserPains` — returns the top N blockers + active decisions from the leader's Memory Web for seeding entry points.

**Components** (`src/components/edge/` + `src/components/memory-web/`):
- `SkillExportCard` — entry-point card on `/context`
- `SkillCaptureSheet` — voice/text capture, bottom sheet on mobile, dialog on desktop
- `SkillPreviewSheet` — preview + download CTA + install guide
- `SkillQualityGate` — quality checklist display
- `SkillInstallGuide` — per-tool install instructions
- `AutomatePainCard` — pain-anchored entry chip row on Edge view

### Edge Pro Gating

Same paywall as `generate-custom-export`. Free users see the locked `SkillExportCard` with a "Pro" badge that opens the Stripe checkout via `useEdgeSubscription.subscribe`. Subscribers get unlimited skill generation.

**Sales Anchor — Skill Builder**: "Describe one weekly workflow out loud. CTRL hands you a Claude Skill that auto-triggers whenever your team's language matches. Two minutes of speaking. Permanent leverage. Drop it in `~/.claude/skills/` and forget it."

## Daily Briefing: Personalised Intelligence with an Evidence-Based Lens

The most sophisticated component of the Leaders tool. Produces a 500-600 word audio briefing every morning, tuned to what this specific leader cares about today. Built on an evidence-based relevance pipeline (v2) that can prove, story by story, why every headline earned its place in front of you.

**Pages / surfaces:**
- `/dashboard` - inline briefing card with expandable segments and quick actions
- `BriefingSheet` - full-screen slide-up with audio player and segment details
- `BriefingPage.tsx` - deep-link view for a specific briefing

### The Pipeline (v2, merged April 2026)

Seven stages, all running inside `generate-briefing/index.ts`:

| Stage | What it does | Model / Tool |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Importance Lens | Ranks the profile items that matter TODAY for THIS briefing type | gpt-4o-mini (structured JSON), 24h cache |
| 2. Query Planner | Turns the lens into 4-6 targeted news queries | gpt-4o-mini |
| 3. Provider Fan-out | Perplexity + Tavily + Brave in parallel, 12s wall-clock cap | `Promise.allSettled` |
| 4. Embedding Dedupe + Scoring | Cosine dedupe, user-exclude filter, relevance scoring | `text-embedding-3-small` (batched), pgvector |
| 5. Budget-Constrained Curation | Picks final segments within word budget with diversity + coverage rules | gpt-4o-mini |
| 6. Script Generation | Writes the audio script using training_material voice + rubric | gpt-4o |
| 7. Audio Synthesis | Generates the MP3 | ElevenLabs (`synthesize-briefing` fire-and-forget) |

Every retained segment carries three evidence fields v1 never captured:
- `lens_item_id` - which lens item this story matched
- `relevance_score` - cosine similarity * lens weight
- `matched_profile_fact` - the quoted text from the user's profile that justifies the story

Routed behind a per-user flag - `user_memory.briefing_v2_enabled`, or the `BRIEFING_V2_ENABLED_DEFAULT` env var. `ai_landscape` briefings stay on v1 (they use synthetic headlines from live AA benchmark data, not live news).

### Briefing Types

| Type | Intent | Pro only? |
|---|---|---|
| `default` ("Daily Brief") | Top stories for your world | No |
| `macro_trends` | Big shifts in AI / markets / regulation | No |
| `vendor_landscape` | Launches, pricing, vendor moves | Yes |
| `competitive_intel` | What your watchlist is doing | Yes |
| `boardroom_prep` | Trends and data for exec presentations | Yes |
| `ai_landscape` | Live benchmarks on models that matter | Yes |
| `custom_voice` | User describes what they need | Yes |

### Briefing Interests (user-declared preferences)

A first-class surface that overrides inferred signals. Three kinds:

- **Beats** - topics you want covered (e.g. "creator monetization", "AI pricing"). Become lens items with weight 1.0. LLM cannot demote them below 0.8.
- **People & Companies** - named entities to track (e.g. "MrBeast", "OpenAI"). Also weight 1.0.
- **Don't show me** - topics to permanently kill. Post-filters the candidate pool - any story within 0.80 cosine of an exclude never surfaces.

**UI:**
- Settings → Interests tab (position 3, after Account + Work)
- Inline `SeedBeatsPrompt` on the dashboard for cold-start users
- Inline Bookmark button on every v2 segment (pins the `matched_profile_fact` as a beat)
- Inline Ban button (records a persistent kill - see below)

**Data:** `briefing_interests` table, RLS-guarded to owner, soft-delete via `is_active`.

### Industry-Aware Seed Beats

Solves the new-user cold-start. Before a user has declared anything, the `SeedBeatsPrompt` proposes a relevant starter set of beats and entities keyed to their declared industry.

**Library (`industry_beat_library` table):**
- 11 industries seeded: `creator_economy`, `saas`, `healthcare`, `finance_fintech`, `consulting_professional_services`, `ecommerce_retail`, `media_publishing`, `education_edtech`, `biotech_life_sciences`, `legal_services`, `generic`
- Each row: 6-8 curated beats + 4-7 recommended entities + fuzzy-match aliases
- Editable via SQL without redeploy (content ops friendly)

**Resolution:** fuzzy match on user's `industry` fact; longest-alias wins; `generic` fallback. Pre-filters anything the user already added or excluded. Taps write `briefing_interests` rows with `source='seed_accepted'`.

### Persistent Semantic Feedback Loop

Promotes thumbs-down from a per-segment reaction into a durable signal that reshapes the lens. Signatures are SHA-256 of `bucket|normalized_text`, so feedback persists across daily lens regenerations.

**Two sources, both stored in `briefing_lens_feedback`:**

1. **Explicit kill** (`source='kill'`, delta = -1.0) - user taps the Ban icon on any v2 segment. Takes effect on the next generation.
2. **Aggregated thumbs-down** (`source='not_useful_aggregate'`, delta = -0.4) - nightly `pg_cron` job (`briefing-aggregate-feedback-nightly`, 03:07 UTC) promotes any lens signature that has accumulated 3+ not_useful reactions in the last 30 days.

`applyFeedbackDeltas` runs in both the cold build path and the cached-lens path, so kills don't need to wait for the 24h lens cache to expire.

**Kill UI:** Ban icon on `SegmentCard` and on `BriefingCard`'s inline segments, hidden on interest-type items (users remove their own interests from the Settings tab instead).

### Feedback That Does Something

Thumbs-up / thumbs-down now capture:
- `lens_item_id` - what the segment was anchored to
- `dwell_ms` - how long the user kept the segment open before reacting
- `replayed` - whether they replayed the audio

This is the substrate the aggregator reads from.

### Segment UI (v2)

Every v2 segment on the dashboard shows:
1. Framework tag badge (SIGNAL / DECISION TRIGGER / KRISH'S TAKE)
2. Headline (rewritten through the leader's lens, 8-16 words)
3. `Anchored to: <lens item>` chip - the evidence
4. Thumbs-up / thumbs-down (feedback)
5. Bookmark (pin the anchor as a persistent beat)
6. Ban (kill the lens signature)
7. Source badge

### Preliminary Insert Pattern

`generate-briefing` writes an EARLY briefing row as soon as raw headlines are scored, so the frontend can show results while curation + script generation run in the background. The frontend polls every 3s; the preliminary row has `script_text = null` and empty `analysis` / `relevance_reason` fields that fill in when curation completes.

### Data Architecture

**Tables**
- `briefings` - one row per briefing (`schema_version = 2` for v2 rows); carries `segments JSONB[]`, `context_snapshot` (lens + queries + excludes), `audio_url`
- `briefing_feedback` - per-segment reactions with v2 fields (`lens_item_id`, `dwell_ms`, `replayed`)
- `briefing_interests` - user-declared beats / entities / excludes
- `industry_beat_library` - reference data for cold-start seeds
- `briefing_lens_feedback` - persistent negative deltas per lens signature
- `ai_response_cache` - lens cache + lens-item embedding cache
- `training_material` - YAML voice guide (structural_rubric, hot_signal_taxonomy, exemplars, watchlist)

**Extensions:** pgvector (for embeddings), pgcrypto (for signature hashing), pg_cron (for the nightly aggregator).

**Edge Functions**
- `generate-briefing` - main pipeline (both v1 + v2 paths)
- `synthesize-briefing` - ElevenLabs audio synthesis
- `briefing-diagnose` - read-only diagnostic: returns profile + lens + last briefing + feedback stats for the authenticated user
- `get-industry-seeds` - returns industry-specific beat / entity suggestions
- `briefing-kill-lens-item` - records an explicit kill
- `briefing-aggregate-feedback` - admin / cron entrypoint (the nightly schedule uses a SQL function `sp_aggregate_briefing_feedback` so no service-role key is needed)

**Shared modules** (`_shared/`)
- `briefing-lens.ts` - Stages 1 + 2 (lens + query planner)
- `briefing-scoring.ts` - Stage 4 (embeddings + dedupe + scoring + exclude filter)
- `briefing-curation.ts` - Stage 5 (budget-constrained picker)
- `user-context.ts` - profile projection (shared with diagnose)
- `lens-signature.ts` - SHA-256 signature of `(type, text)` for stable feedback keying
- `training-loader.ts`, `ai-cache.ts`, `model-router.ts`, `rateLimit.ts` - reused infra

**Frontend hooks**
- `useBriefing` - briefing fetch + polling
- `useBriefingInterests` - CRUD for the Interests tab
- `useIndustrySeeds` - cold-start suggestions
- `useKillLensItem` - kill action wrapper

### Pipeline Flags / Env Vars

- `BRIEFING_V2_ENABLED_DEFAULT` - global default for v2 routing (`false` to stay on v1)
- `BRIEFING_DEDUPE_THRESHOLD` - cosine threshold for headline dedupe (default 0.87)
- `BRIEFING_EXCLUDE_THRESHOLD` - cosine threshold for user-exclude post-filter (default 0.80)

### Reliability hardening (Audit Week 4)

The briefing pipeline ships with concrete reliability primitives:
- **`with-timeout` utility** (`supabase/functions/_shared/with-timeout.ts`, tested) wraps every external API call with explicit timeouts and retries.
- **Provider fan-out** uses `Promise.allSettled` with a 12-second wall-clock cap so a single slow provider can't block the briefing.
- **Audio failure UX**: if synthesis fails, the briefing card still shows segments + script. The MP3 is fire-and-forget and degrades gracefully.
- **Rate limits** on `generate-briefing` (Audit Week 1) prevent abuse and runaway cost.
- **Onboarding stall recovery** for users who started a briefing then closed the app.

### Observability (Audit Week 5)

- **Structured edge-function logger** (`supabase/functions/_shared/logger.ts`) emits JSON logs with `ts`, `level`, `fn`, `msg`, `userId`, `duration_ms`, `error`. Searchable in Supabase logs.
- **CI gate** prevents `console.log` regressions in edge functions.
- **`with-timeout` test coverage** validates retry + timeout behaviour.

**Sales Anchor — Daily Briefing**: "Three minutes a day that replace thirty minutes of scrolling. Every story shows the specific profile fact it was anchored to. Bookmark to keep a beat. Ban to kill a topic semantically. Your briefing gets sharper every day."

## Audit Track Record (April 2026)

CTRL shipped six thematic audit weeks closing technical debt and hardening the product for executive use. Sales/marketing AI agents can cite these as **proof of operational maturity** — this is not a prototype, it's a hardened production platform.

| Week | Theme | Headline Outcomes |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 (PR #93) | **Revenue path** | Mandatory Stripe webhook signature verification; webhook idempotency table (`stripe_events_processed`); briefing rate limits; create/verify diagnostic payment hardened; Edge Pro subscription path validated |
| 2 (PR #94) | **Data path** | Closed assessment data leak; codified storage bucket policy (`ctrl-briefings`); end-to-end account deletion; RLS audit |
| 3 (PR #95) | **UX** | Killed onboarding gate; fixed NorthStar stub; voice permission recovery; killed surveillance copy; removed all "coming soon" placeholders for unimplemented affordances |
| 4 (PR #99) | **Reliability** | Timeouts + retries on all external APIs (`with-timeout` utility, tested); audio failure UX; onboarding stall recovery |
| 5 (PR #97) | **Observability** | Structured edge-function JSON logger (`_shared/logger.ts`); CI gate against `console.log` regressions; tests for `with-timeout` |
| 6 (PR #98, #100, #101) | **Cleanup** | P2 backlog closure; stale-incomplete recovery; e2e contract starter (auth, briefing, account-deletion, stripe-idempotency, sparse-profile, briefing-rate-limits); AI response cache; lint cleanup |

### Verifiable proof points for buyers

- Stripe webhook handler validates signatures and dedupes events — buyers concerned about double-charges or webhook spoofing can audit `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/`
- E2E test `tests/stripe-webhook-idempotency.spec.ts` proves it
- E2E test `tests/account-deletion.spec.ts` proves account deletion is end-to-end
- E2E test `tests/briefing-rate-limits.spec.ts` proves rate limiting is enforced
- E2E test `tests/sparse-profile.spec.ts` proves the briefing pipeline gracefully handles new/empty profiles

---

## Settings — what users actually control

Settings sheet (`src/components/settings/`) tabs in current order:

1. **AccountTab** — name, email, password, sign-out, delete account (end-to-end)
2. **WorkContextTab** — role, company, industry, company size (drives briefing seeds + AI context)
3. **BriefingInterestsTab** — declare beats, entities, excludes (Briefing v2 lens inputs)
4. **BriefingDirectivesTab** — set briefing type defaults, voice, schedule
5. **EdgeProTab** — Edge Pro subscription state, billing portal, capability list
6. **PreferencesTab** — display/theme/audio preferences
7. **PrivacyDataTab** — data retention, export, deletion, consent flags
8. **ManifestoTab** — the founder's positioning (legible to users; explains what we're not)

**Sales Anchor — Settings**: "Every setting is a lever the leader controls — what gets stored, what gets killed, what gets generated. No mystery dial behind the scenes."
