## Architecture Issues

### Issue 1: Dual Architecture Conflict
**Symptom**: UI shows empty/stale data despite successful backend generation
**Root Cause**: V1 components (prop-based) coexisted with V2 (DB-based)
**Solution**: Deleted `AILeadershipBenchmark.tsx` and `PromptLibraryResults.tsx`
**Status**: ✅ Resolved (Jan 2025)

### Issue 2: Null/Undefined Cascade
**Symptom**: UI crashes or shows "undefined" text
**Root Cause**: Missing null guards in data aggregation
**Solution**: Implemented `pipelineGuards.ts` with safe defaults
**Status**: ✅ Resolved (Jan 2025)

### Issue 3: Edge Function Timeouts
**Symptom**: Assessment hangs on "Generating insights..."
**Root Cause**: Sequential edge function calls, LLM timeouts
**Solution**: Parallelised calls, added timeout protection
**Status**: ⚠️ Improved but monitor

---

## Data Flow Issues

### Issue 4: AssessmentId Not Passed
**Symptom**: Results page shows loading spinner forever
**Root Cause**: `assessmentId` not in URL or state after completion
**Solution**: Store in `AssessmentContext` and URL params
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 5: Missing Dimension Scores
**Symptom**: Benchmark chart shows 0s or empty
**Root Cause**: `storeDimensionScores()` not called in orchestration
**Solution**: Added explicit call in `orchestrateAssessmentV2.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

---

## UI Issues

### Issue 6: Dark Mode Contrast
**Symptom**: Text unreadable in dark mode
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded colors (e.g., `text-white`, `bg-black`)
**Solution**: Use semantic tokens (`text-foreground`, `bg-background`)
**Prevention**: Enforce token usage in code reviews
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 7: Mobile Layout Breaks
**Symptom**: Content overflows, buttons cut off
**Root Cause**: Fixed widths, missing responsive classes
**Solution**: Use `max-w-{size}`, `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
**Prevention**: Test on mobile before shipping
**Status**: ⚠️ Ongoing monitoring

---

## LLM Issues

### Issue 8: Hallucinated Insights
**Symptom**: Insights reference data user didn't provide
**Root Cause**: LLM generating plausible but false content
**Solution**: Require evidence citations, validate against user answers
**Prevention**: Use `quality-guardrails.ts` validation
**Status**: ⚠️ Improved but not eliminated

### Issue 9: Generic Prompts
**Symptom**: Prompts don't feel personalised
**Root Cause**: Insufficient context in LLM call
**Solution**: Enhanced `context-builder.ts` with deep profile
**Status**: ✅ Improved

---

## Payment Issues

### Issue 10: Payment Success But No Upgrade
**Symptom**: User pays but still sees free tier
**Root Cause**: `has_full_diagnostic` flag not set
**Solution**: Update flag in `handlePaymentSuccess.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

---

## Dec 2024 Audit Fixes

### Issue 11: Broken Assessment History Viewing
**Symptom**: Users couldn't view past assessments from history
**Root Cause**: `viewingAssessmentId` state was set but never used
**Solution**: Implemented complete viewing flow in `Index.tsx` with data loading
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 12: NotFound Using Wrong Design Tokens
**Symptom**: 404 page looked inconsistent with rest of app
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded gray/blue colors instead of design system
**Solution**: Complete redesign using Card, Button, and proper tokens
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 13: Unlock Form Not Creating Accounts
**Symptom**: Users "unlocked" results but no account was created
**Root Cause**: `handleUnlock` had TODO - no Supabase auth implementation
**Solution**: Implemented proper signUp flow with existing account handling
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 14: Eternal Loading on Missing Assessment ID
**Symptom**: Results page would show spinner forever if ID not found
**Root Cause**: No retry logic or error state for assessment ID restoration
**Solution**: Added 3-attempt retry with proper error messaging
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 15: Checkbox Boolean/String Mismatch
**Symptom**: Consent checkbox validation sometimes failed incorrectly
**Root Cause**: Converting boolean to string in onChange handler
**Solution**: Direct boolean assignment with proper state update
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

## V3 Visual Issues (Jan 2026)

### Issue 16: Mobile Viewport Overflow
**Symptom**: Pages required vertical scrolling on mobile devices
**Root Cause**: Fixed heights, large padding, non-responsive components
**Solution**: Use `--mobile-vh`, compact padding on mobile, responsive components
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 17: Peer Comparison Matrix Squashed on Mobile
**Symptom**: Chart was 500px height with large margins, unusable on mobile
**Root Cause**: Fixed chart dimensions, large font sizes
**Solution**: Responsive height (280px mobile, 400px desktop), compact labels
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 18: Video Background Blocked
**Symptom**: Video background not visible, solid black background instead
**Root Cause**: `bg-background` on App.tsx root creating opaque layer
**Solution**: Remove `bg-background` from App.tsx, control backgrounds at component level
**Prevention**: ESLint rule, build validation script
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 19: Double Underlines
**Symptom**: Text with SVG decorative underline also had CSS underline
**Root Cause**: Using both `underline` class and SVG underline
**Solution**: Remove `underline` class when using SVG decorative underlines
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 20: Buttons With Visible Borders
**Symptom**: Primary buttons had visible borders that didn't match design
**Root Cause**: Default button styles not overridden
**Solution**: Add `border-0` explicitly to all button variants
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 21: Inconsistent Card Padding
**Symptom**: Cards had varying padding across the app
**Root Cause**: No standardised padding scale
**Solution**: Standardised to `p-8 sm:p-12 md:p-16 lg:p-20` for cards
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 22: Animation Too Bouncy
**Symptom**: Animations felt playful rather than executive
**Root Cause**: Spring physics too bouncy
**Solution**: Adjusted to stiffness: 400, damping: 35, mass: 0.8
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Memory Center Implementation (Jan 2026)

### Issue 23: Memory Table Not Found
**Symptom**: Memory Center shows "Failed to load memories" error
**Root Cause**: Database migrations not applied to Supabase instance
**Solution**: Run migrations via Supabase CLI: `supabase db push`
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires migration deployment

### Issue 24: Memory Settings Not Loading
**Symptom**: Privacy tab shows error loading settings
**Root Cause**: `user_memory_settings` table doesn't exist
**Solution**: Apply `20260125000000_memory_privacy_settings.sql` migration
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires migration deployment

### Memory Center Patterns

**React Query Integration:**
- All memory operations use `useMemoryQueries.ts` hook
- Optimistic updates for create/update/delete
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- Inline error states (no toasts)

**Offline Draft Storage:**
- Drafts stored in localStorage with key `mindmaker-memory-draft`
- 24-hour expiration on drafts
- User prompted to restore or discard on sheet open

**Encryption:**
- Memory content encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Encryption key stored in `MEMORY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var
- Decryption only happens in edge functions, never client-side
- Never log raw memory content in console

## Missions System Issues (Feb 2026)

### Issue 25: First Moves Not Displaying
**Symptom**: Assessment completes but no First Moves shown on results page
**Root Cause**: `leader_first_moves` table migration not applied or `ai-generate` not returning first moves in response
**Solution**: Verify migration `20251119111446` is applied, check `ai-generate` response includes `first_moves` array
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor on deployment

### Issue 26: Mission Status Not Updating
**Symptom**: Completing or skipping a mission doesn't update status
**Root Cause**: RLS policy may prevent update if `leader_id` doesn't match
**Solution**: Verify RLS policy allows status updates for own missions
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires verification

---

## Progress Tracking Issues (Feb 2026)

### Issue 27: Drift Score Calculation
**Symptom**: Drift score shows unexpected values or NaN
**Root Cause**: Missing baseline assessment data or null dimension scores
**Solution**: Add null guards in `compute-drift` function, ensure baseline exists before computing
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor

### Issue 28: Batch Drift Timeout
**Symptom**: `batch-compute-drift` edge function times out
**Root Cause**: Processing too many leaders in a single invocation
**Solution**: Implement pagination/batching within the function, increase timeout
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor

---

## AI Model Issues (Feb 2026)

### Issue 29: Vertex AI Authentication Failure
**Symptom**: AI generation falls back to OpenAI consistently
**Root Cause**: Google service account key expired or misconfigured
**Solution**: Verify `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` in Supabase secrets, check OAuth token caching
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor

### Issue 30: AI Cache Stale Content
**Symptom**: Users with similar profiles get identical insights
**Root Cause**: AI cache too aggressive, matching on insufficient key dimensions
**Solution**: Review cache key generation in `_shared/ai-cache.ts`, ensure profile-specific differentiation
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor

---

## Daily Briefing Issues (Apr 2026 - v2 pipeline)

### Issue 31: Briefing Headlines Are Wildly Off-Topic for the User
**Symptom**: User opens today's briefing and sees 4-5 generic stories (geopolitics, executive tech conferences, generic fintech) instead of anything relevant to their actual industry or role.
**Root Cause (most common)**: User has not declared any `briefing_interests`, AND the inferred profile from voice sessions is shallow or generic (typical pattern: "grow the business", "hire a team"). The v2 lens has nothing specific to anchor against.
**Diagnosis**: Call `briefing-diagnose` from the browser console. Check `profile.interests` (empty?), `lens[0..2]` (generic goals?), and `last_briefing.segments[*].matched_profile_fact` (is it tied to anything specific?).
**Solution**:
  1. Get the user to Settings → Interests and declare 3-5 beats + 3-5 entities + 1-2 excludes (fastest fix).
  2. Or: have them accept the `SeedBeatsPrompt` on the dashboard (industry-aware one-tap seeds).
  3. Regenerate the briefing with force=true (`Refresh stories` on the card). The new lens will include the declared interests at weight 1.0.
**Status**: ✅ Resolved via Interests feature + SeedBeatsPrompt (PR #87, PR #88).

### Issue 32: User Can't Find the Interests UI After v2 Ship
**Symptom**: User was told "go to Interests" but doesn't see the tab.
**Root Cause**: Frontend cache (Vercel's CDN can serve stale index.html with old chunk hashes for 24h+ on some paths). OR the user merged main but didn't trigger a fresh Vercel production deploy. OR they have an old tab/window open.
**Solution**:
  1. Check `ctrl.themindmaker.ai` main bundle hash (`curl -s ... | grep 'assets/index-'`). Compare to latest Vercel deployment output. Mismatch = stale.
  2. Force a redeploy via Vercel API (`POST /v13/deployments` with `forceNew=1` and the main sha).
  3. User hard-refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) or incognito window.
  4. Confirm the `Interests` tab sits at position 3 in Settings (after Account + Work).
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor - CDN cache behaviour is the recurring culprit.

### Issue 33: `generate-briefing` Throws "Lens Empty" on New Users
**Symptom**: v2 pipeline returns 500 with message "Lens empty — user has no profile data to personalise against".
**Root Cause**: The user has zero entries in `user_memory`, `user_missions`, `user_decisions`, and `briefing_interests`. `deterministicLens` produces an empty array and v2 refuses to proceed.
**Solution**: Either (a) send the user through onboarding to seed `user_memory`, (b) have them declare 3+ `briefing_interests`, or (c) temporarily flip them to v1 via `user_memory` row `{fact_key: 'briefing_v2_enabled', fact_value: 'false', is_current: true}`.
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor - probably needs a graceful fallback to industry-only seeds when lens is empty.

### Issue 34: Killed Lens Item Reappears Next Day
**Symptom**: User taps Ban on a segment; next day the same topic is back.
**Root Cause (unlikely but possible)**: The kill wrote a signature that doesn't match what the new lens generates. Likely culprit: the v2 lens used an `interest_beat_*` id whose `lens_item_id` starts with `interest_` - the Ban button is hidden for those (users remove interests from Settings instead, intentionally). If still repeating: check `briefing_lens_feedback` for the signature, verify `is_active = true`, and that `applyFeedbackDeltas` is running (log line `briefing-lens: loadLensFeedbackDeltas`).
**Solution**: Check DB row. If present and active, debug `computeLensSignature` bucketing. If absent, the kill endpoint failed - check function logs.
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor.

### Issue 35: Nightly Aggregator Not Promoting Obvious Negatives
**Symptom**: User has banned "geopolitics" repeatedly via thumbs-down, but no `not_useful_aggregate` row appears.
**Root Cause**: Aggregator requires >= 3 not_useful reactions on the SAME lens signature within 30 days. Different wording of "geopolitics" across briefings produces different signatures.
**Diagnosis**: `SELECT lens_item_text, COUNT(*) FROM briefing_feedback f JOIN briefings b ON b.id = f.briefing_id CROSS JOIN LATERAL jsonb_array_elements(b.context_snapshot->'lens') li WHERE f.reaction = 'not_useful' AND li->>'id' = f.lens_item_id GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC;`
**Solution**: User should Ban explicitly instead of thumbs-down (kills at -1.0 immediately, no threshold). Or: widen the signature bucketing in `_shared/lens-signature.ts` if the pattern shows up repeatedly.
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor.

### Issue 36: Briefing Takes > 30 Seconds on Cold Start
**Symptom**: User triggers a briefing and it takes 30-45 seconds before the preliminary row even appears.
**Root Cause**: All five v2 LLM hops run sequentially on cache miss: lens (1.5s) → planner (1.5s) → providers (up to 12s) → embeddings + scoring (1s) → curation (3s) = ~19s + script gen (4-6s). If Perplexity is slow (often), total can exceed 30s.
**Solution**:
  1. Trigger provider warmup speculatively alongside the query planner (not yet implemented).
  2. Confirm Perplexity is responsive via direct test call.
  3. Ensure `lens` cache is warm: regeneration within 24h uses cached lens (saves ~1.5s).
  4. As a last resort, bump the generation timeout in `useBriefing.ts` (currently 60s).
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitor. The 12s Stage 3 wall-clock cap protects against worst-case provider hangs.
