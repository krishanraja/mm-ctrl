# CTRL Project Documentation

**Master Index**

This folder is the canonical source of truth for the CTRL portable AI context platform. Everything else at the repo root has been removed in the 2026-04-26 docs refresh — if it's not in this folder or in the root `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `CHANGELOG.md`, it was historical noise.

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-13
**Current Version:** v5.2 (Skill Builder + desktop UI redesign shipped on top of v5.1's audit-hardened base)

## AI Reasoning Framework

All AI-generated insights are anchored in cognitive frameworks embedded in the `ai-generate` edge function.

### Five Core Cognitive Frameworks
1. **A/B Framing** — Reframe decisions to expose bias (positive vs negative framing)
2. **Dialectical Tension** — Thesis-antithesis-synthesis for balanced reasoning
3. **Mental Contrasting (WOOP)** — Goals, obstacles, and realistic planning
4. **Reflective Equilibrium** — Aligning decisions with organizational principles
5. **First-Principles Thinking** — Fundamental problem-solving, challenging assumptions

### AI Response Requirements
- Never provide generic advice disconnected from user's specific context
- Always tie insights to specific assessment data and user answers
- Apply appropriate cognitive framework based on decision type
- Present multiple perspectives before synthesizing recommendations
- Calibrate confidence levels to reasoning quality
- Challenge assumptions through Socratic questioning

## Current State (v5.2 — verified 2026-05-13)

### Product Positioning
- **Tagline**: "Clarity for Leaders"
- **Core Value**: Decision speed for leaders. Portable AI context that makes every AI tool personalised, an evidence-based daily briefing anchored to real priorities, and a Skill Builder that turns repetitive leader workflows into agentskills.io-compliant Claude Skills.
- **Time to Value**: 2 minutes to first export. 3 minutes a day for the Briefing. One voice description (~2-5 minutes) for a downloadable Agent Skill.

### Design Philosophy
- **Apple-like quality**: Executive-grade, 10/10 visual polish — extended in v5.2 with a desktop-native shell (sticky top bar + optional right rail + global Command Palette via Cmd/Ctrl+K)
- **Voice-first**: Talk naturally, structure extracted automatically
- **Mobile-first**: No-scroll experience on key authed surfaces, with a parallel desktop shell that is no longer stretched mobile markup
- **Light mode**: Warm off-white backgrounds, deep ink text, pure white cards

Quality gate enforces 5+ trigger phrases, push language, third-person voice, body under 500 lines, imperative voice, required sections, valid name format. Pain-anchored entry points: chip row of blockers + active decisions on Edge view (`AutomatePainCard`), zap button on Memory Web blocker cards, zap button on Briefing `decision_trigger` segments. Five archetypes: decision-framework, voice-lock, reporting-engine, tool-integration, getting-started.

## Terminology Standards

- **Memory Web** — Living knowledge base of facts about the leader
- **AI Double / Digital Clone** — The exportable context that represents the leader
- **Context Export** — Formatted output for AI tools
- **Skill Builder / Agent Skill Builder** — The voice-to-Agent-Skill pipeline. The output is an "Agent Skill" or just "Skill". Never call it a "macro", "automation script", or "workflow template" in customer-facing copy.
- **Agent Skill** — A downloadable, agentskills.io-compliant skill bundle (`SKILL.md` + references + test prompts + install guide) the leader drops into `~/.claude/skills/`. Triggers automatically when the leader's language matches.
- **Three Honest Tests** — The triage gate inside `generate-skill-export`. Inputs that fail it get routed to the right surface (Memory Web fact, Custom Instruction, Saved Style) instead of producing a junk skill.
- **Pain-anchored entry point** — Any UI surface (Edge `AutomatePainCard`, Memory blocker zap, Briefing `decision_trigger` zap) that hands the leader's already-declared pain to the Skill Builder via a `SkillSeed` so generation is grounded in their actual language.
- **10X Skills** — Strengths identified for amplification. Not to be confused with Agent Skills.
- **Blind Spots** — Gaps or risks surfaced by pattern detection
- **Diagnostic** — The assessment process (never "quiz" or "test")
- **Tensions** — Strategic gaps between current and desired state
- **Risk Signals** — Blind spots, waste, or theatre indicators
- **Thinking Tools** — Mental models and prompts (not "prompt library")
- **First Moves** — Prioritized next steps from diagnostic
- **Missions** — Active commitment to a First Move with check-in tracking
- **Memory Facts** — Individual verified data points in the Memory Web
- **Temperature** — Memory fact recency/relevance (hot/warm/cold)
- **Anchored to** — The exact phrase shown on every Briefing v2 segment, naming the profile fact that earned its slot
- **Auditable Relevance** — The product property: every recommendation can be traced to a specific profile fact
- **Zero-Context Tax** — The pain CTRL eliminates: re-explaining yourself to AI tools every session
- **Command Palette** — Desktop-only Cmd/Ctrl+K launcher (`CommandPaletteProvider`)
