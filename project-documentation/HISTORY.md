## Timeline

### Phase 1: AI Leadership Benchmark (Original)
**Period**: Early 2024
**Positioning**: "AI-led transformation" platform
**Features**:
- Quiz-based assessment
- AI Leadership Benchmark scoring
- Prompt library generation
- Generic AI coaching

**Issues**:
- Felt like "ChatGPT quiz wrapper"
- Unclear differentiation from free tools
- Hype-driven messaging alienated senior leaders
- No clear business model

---

### Phase 2: Dual Architecture Addition
**Period**: Mid 2024
**Changes**:
- Added V2 components alongside V1
- Created `LeadershipBenchmarkV2.tsx`, `PromptLibraryV2.tsx`
- Added voice assessment path
- Introduced deep profile questionnaire

**Issues**:
- Two architectures coexisting (prop-based vs DB-based)
- Conditional rendering caused stale UI
- Inconsistent user experience
- Technical debt accumulated

---

### Phase 3: AI Literacy Repositioning (Current)
**Period**: January 2025
**Changes**:
- Repositioned as "AI literacy for executive cognition"
- Removed V1 components entirely
- Unified architecture (DB-based only)
- Reframed copy (removed quiz/gamification language)
- Surfaced tensions, risks, scenarios
- Renamed "Prompt Library" to "Thinking Tools"

**Outcomes**:
- Single, coherent architecture
- Senior, professional tone
- Clear differentiation from alternatives
- Anti-fragile pipeline guarantees

## Major Pivots

### Pivot 1: From Implementation to Literacy
**Before**: "We help you implement AI in your organisation"
**After**: "We help you develop AI literacy to make better decisions"
**Rationale**: Leaders need mental models, not tools

### Pivot 2: From Quiz to Diagnostic
**Before**: "Take our AI leadership quiz!"
**After**: "Complete a 10-minute diagnostic"
**Rationale**: Senior leaders don't take quizzes

### Pivot 3: From Scores to Tensions
**Before**: Hero metric was benchmark score (0-100)
**After**: Hero content is tensions, risks, scenarios
**Rationale**: Leaders need to see gaps, not grades

### Pivot 4: From Prompts to Mental Models
**Before**: "Get AI prompts to use"
**After**: "Get thinking tools for daily decisions"
**Rationale**: Context matters more than templates

## Key Learnings

1. **Positioning is everything**: "AI literacy" resonates, "AI transformation" doesn't
2. **Senior UX matters**: Emojis and gamification alienate executives
3. **Architecture debt compounds**: Dual architecture caused cascading issues
4. **AI must be backstage**: Show outcomes, not "AI-powered" labels
5. **Evidence over generic**: Tie insights to specific user answers
