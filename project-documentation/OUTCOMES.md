## Leader Outcomes

### Immediate Outcomes (First Session — 2 Minutes)

**Portable AI Double Created**
- AI double built from 3 guided voice questions. No typing. No forms.
- Context exported to at least one AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Claude Code).
- Leader experiences personalized AI output for the first time and immediately feels the gap from what they had before.

**Decision Speed Unlocked**
- The next AI conversation starts with context, not a blank page.
- First real decision gets sharper input because the AI knows their role, priorities, and constraints.
- The cost of switching between AI tools drops to zero.

**Cognitive Shift**
- "I just talked for two minutes and now Claude knows my entire world."
- "Why was I typing system prompts by hand?"
- "This is what AI was supposed to feel like."

**Measurable:**
- 100% have exportable context within 2 minutes
- 90%+ report noticeably better AI responses after first export
- 80%+ export to a second AI tool within 24 hours

### Day 1-2 Outcomes (Briefing kicks in)

**Cold-start solved with one tap**
- `SeedBeatsPrompt` surfaces on the dashboard with industry-relevant beats and entities (one of 11 pre-seeded industries: creator economy, SaaS, fintech, healthcare, consulting, e-commerce, media, edtech, biotech, legal, generic).
- One tap accepts a starter set of beats, weight 1.0.
- First briefing lands with 3-5 stories, each visibly anchored to something the leader cares about ("Anchored to: <beat or decision>").

**Auditable relevance from day one**
- The leader can tell, at a glance, WHY each story earned the slot. No mystery algorithm.
- Confidence in the system established on the first interaction, before any tuning.

---

### 7-Day Outcomes

**Decision Speed Compounding**
- AI conversations that used to take 10 minutes of setup now take zero.
- Decision Advisor or Meeting Prep used for at least one real decision, not a test.
- Leader starts reaching for AI first when facing a complex decision, because the output is actually useful now.

**Memory Web Growth**
- Added voice input beyond initial onboarding. Context is deepening.
- Memory Web has 15+ verified facts across categories.
- Pattern detection surfacing initial strengths and blind spots the leader had not articulated.
- Context exports getting richer. Each AI tool gets a more complete picture.

**Briefing Tightening**
- Leader has declared 4-8 interests (beats + entities) via seed acceptance or manual add.
- Excluded 1-3 topics they never want to see again.
- At least one **Bookmark** tap (promoting a story's anchor to a persistent beat).
- Briefing is noticeably tighter than day-1 because the lens now weights declared interests at 1.0.

**Behavioral Change**
- Stopped writing manual system prompts. CTRL export replaced them.
- Started narrating context updates when priorities or challenges shift.
- Using AI for real decisions weekly, not occasional experiments.

**What Leaders Say:**
- "I used to dread switching to a new AI tool. Now I just export and go."
- "My meeting prep brief knew things about my team dynamics that I forgot to mention."
- "I made a hiring decision faster this week because the Decision Advisor already knew my team structure."
- "The Briefing showed me a competitor move that I would have missed for two days. That alone is worth it."

**Measurable:**
- 70%+ have used built-in AI tools (Decision Advisor, Meeting Prep, Prompt Coach)
- 60%+ exported to 2+ platforms
- 50%+ added voice input beyond onboarding
- 40%+ report making at least one decision faster due to CTRL context
- 80%+ of new users accept at least 3 seed beats within first dashboard session

### 30-Day Outcomes

**Decision Speed as Standard**
- Every AI tool the leader uses is personalized. Generic AI interactions are gone.
- Time saved: 5-10 minutes of context setup eliminated per AI conversation.
- AI is now a genuine thinking partner: informed, specific, and fast.

**Decision Quality Improvement**
- Decision Advisor used for real strategic decisions: hiring, investment, priority calls.
- Meeting Prep generating contextual briefs that surface relevant history and stakeholder dynamics.
- Decisions are faster and sharper. The leader can articulate why.

**Briefing Learning Loop Activated**
- Feedback loop activating: 3+ thumbs-downs on generic topics automatically promote to persistent `-0.4` weight deltas (via the nightly `sp_aggregate_briefing_feedback` job at 03:07 UTC). Topics start disappearing even without explicit Bans.
- Leader catches a decision-relevant story in a briefing (something on their watchlist moved, a regulatory shift, a pricing change) and acts on it same-day.
- Briefing becomes a ritual. The 3-minute audio fits into the morning commute / first coffee window.
- Custom briefings (vendor_landscape, competitive_intel, boardroom_prep) used for specific prep moments.

**AI Literacy Gained**
- Can ask 3-5 sharp questions about any AI proposal or vendor pitch.
- Using AI as a weekly thinking partner for analysis and strategic decisions.
- Has redirected or reduced spend on at least one low-ROI AI initiative.

**Edge Pro Upgrade Path**
- Used Edge to generate a board memo, strategy doc, or email in their own register.
- ~25-30% of engaged users convert to Edge Pro at $9/month within 30 days.

**First Agent Skill Shipped**
- The leader has hit a pain-anchored zap (Edge `AutomatePainCard`, Memory blocker, Briefing `decision_trigger`) at least once and generated their first Agent Skill.
- ZIP downloaded and installed into Claude Code / Claude.ai / Cursor — they paste a test prompt and watch the skill auto-trigger. That moment ("the skill just fired in my Claude with my voice") is the second "aha" after the first Context Export.
- The Three Honest Tests gate routed at least one input to Memory Web or Custom Instructions instead of generating a junk skill — they learn to trust the triage, not work around it.
- ~15-20% of Edge Pro users have at least one shipped skill within 30 days of subscribing.

**What Leaders Say:**
- "My CFO asked how I prepared that board memo so fast. I just smiled."
- "I killed an AI project this week that would have wasted six months. I knew the right questions to ask."
- "I cannot go back to using AI without context. It would be like losing my phone."
- "I banned 'geopolitics' once. It's gone. That's how this should work."

**Measurable:**
- 80%+ using context export as standard workflow (not optional, not experimental)
- 70%+ report "AI is dramatically more useful now"
- 60%+ challenged or redirected an AI initiative with sharper judgment
- 50%+ report saving 30+ minutes per week on AI-related context setup
- 40%+ use the Ban action at least once in first 30 days (semantic feedback working)
- 70%+ of v2 briefings have every segment carrying a `matched_profile_fact` (evidence coverage)
- 15-20% of Edge Pro users have shipped at least one Agent Skill within 30 days of subscribing

### 90-Day Outcomes

**Compounding AI Advantage**
- Memory Web is rich, comprehensive, and current. It evolves as the leader evolves.
- Every AI interaction feels like talking to an informed chief of staff, not a stranger.
- Pattern detection has surfaced actionable strengths and blind spots that changed how the leader operates.
- The gap between this leader and peers using AI generically is now significant and widening.

**Strategic Capability**

## Cross-Outcome Success Indicators

### Qualitative Indicators (What Leaders Actually Say)

**Speed and Context**
- "I talked for two minutes and now every AI tool knows me."
- "I exported to Claude and it was like briefing a new advisor who already read my entire file."
- "I stopped writing system prompts. CTRL does it better and keeps it current."
- "My AI conversations went from generic to genuinely useful overnight."

**Decisions and Judgment**
- "I made a better call on that acquisition because the Decision Advisor already knew our risk profile."
- "I can now challenge AI proposals without faking it."
- "We stopped a bad AI project early. That alone paid for a year of CTRL."
- "I know which questions to ask. That changed everything."

**Briefing and Auditable Relevance**
- "I finally have a news feed that doesn't waste my time."
- "It caught a competitor move that I would have missed. That alone is worth it."
- "I can see exactly why each story is there. No more AI mystery box."
- "I banned 'geopolitics' once. It's gone. That's how it should work."

### Quantitative Indicators

**Engagement Metrics**
- Onboarding completion rate >80%
- Context export within first session >90%
- Weekly voice input updates >50%
- Multi-platform export >60%
- Briefing open rate (audio play started) >60% by day 7

**Decision Speed Metrics**
- AI conversation setup time: reduced from 5-10 min to 0
- Time to first useful AI output per session: reduced by 70%+
- Decision cycle time reduction: 20-40% (user-reported)
- AI tool switching cost: eliminated

**Briefing Quality Metrics**
- % of segments with `matched_profile_fact` populated: 90%+ on v2 briefings
- Bookmark rate per briefing: 0.5-1.5 segments (depending on engagement)
- Ban rate per briefing: <0.5 (a healthy briefing rarely needs banning; sustained > 0.5 indicates the lens is too generic)
- Time-to-decision-relevant story: median <7 days

**Impact Metrics**
- AI interaction quality improvement (user-reported): 80%+ rate "significantly better"
- AI spend efficiency: reduction in low-ROI AI initiatives
- Leadership AI confidence: self-reported improvement in ability to lead AI conversations

**Revenue Indicators (for product/marketing)**
- Free → $49 Diagnostic conversion: 5-10% in first 30 days
- Free → $9/mo Edge Pro conversion: 15-25% by day 30 (higher among Memory Web active users)
- Bundle ($69) attach rate: ~30% of Diagnostic buyers
- Net revenue retention on Edge Pro: target 110%+ via expansion to add-ons

---

### Anti-Metrics (What We Do Not Measure)

- **Number of facts stored** — Quality of context over quantity. A Memory Web with 30 sharp facts beats 300 generic ones.
- **Time spent in CTRL** — We measure value delivered per second, not time on platform. The goal is speed, not engagement.
- **Feature usage breadth** — Focused outcomes over feature bloat. Using one tool well beats touching every feature.
- **Quiz scores** — The diagnostic is a mirror, not an exam. We do not gamify literacy.
- **Daily active usage** — Leaders are busy. If CTRL makes them faster three times a week, that is a win. We do not need daily dopamine loops.
- **Briefing word count** — A 500-word briefing that surfaces one decision-changing story beats a 1,500-word one that surfaces none.

## Sales & Marketing Anchors (for AI agents)

Use these outcomes as proof points in copy:

- **"2 minutes to first export"** — verified by GuidedFirstExperience telemetry
- **"30+ minutes a day reclaimed"** — context-setup time + news scrolling time eliminated
- **"Anchored to:" promise** — every Briefing segment can prove its relevance with a specific profile fact
- **"Bans persist forever"** — semantic, not keyword; signature-keyed so feedback survives daily lens regeneration
- **"3-minute audio briefing"** — concrete, time-boxed, measurable
- **"Edge Pro $9/month"** — anchor pricing in copy; cheaper than a single coffee per week, cheaper than any AI tool subscription that already lives in the leader's stack
- **Earliest "WOW" moment** — accept seed beats → first Briefing audio plays → leader says "this is actually about me" within first 24h
- **Strongest retention signal** — first Bookmark tap; correlates with continued usage and Pro upgrade
