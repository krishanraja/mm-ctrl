/**
 * capture-week - stage 9 of the harness chain, LEARN. The weekly pass that
 * turns review history into proposed changes to a person's standard.
 *
 * POST (cron only) -> 200 { week, users, proposed, ... }
 *
 * This is the last stage in the chain and the only one that changes a standard,
 * and it never changes one itself. It writes rows to `proposals` with status
 * 'awaiting'. A named human accepts or rejects each one at /proposals. There is
 * no code path in this file that writes `criteria`: `criteria` is read, twice,
 * and never inserted, updated or deleted. A standard that changes without a
 * decision is a standard nobody owns.
 *
 * `skills/ctrl-capture` is the managed reference implementation of exactly this
 * stage and this function follows it: two strikes, the three types in order,
 * one message of decisions rather than a report, a size delta on every
 * proposal, an `if_wrong` on every proposal, and silence when there is nothing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DEPLOY WITH verify_jwt = false
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * pg_cron calls this over net.http_post with a bearer secret, not a user JWT,
 * so the platform's JWT verification has to be off and the gate below IS the
 * auth. Same shape as memory-sweep and decision-watch: a dedicated shared
 * secret or the exact service-role key. Unverified JWT payload claims are never
 * trusted. Anything else is 403 before a single row is read.
 *
 *   supabase functions deploy capture-week --no-verify-jwt
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * No model chooses anything here (spec 4.9, section 9)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Two strikes and the three types are arithmetic over ledger rows, and all of
 * it lives in ../_shared/capture-core.ts where vitest can pin it. There is no
 * LLM call in this function at all. A model asked to read a week of ledger and
 * find "what keeps coming up" finds something every week, which is precisely
 * the failure two strikes exists to prevent. If wording ever needs drafting, a
 * model may draft the headline and delta of candidates ALREADY selected here;
 * it may never select one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The quarterly pass, and how "every thirteenth run" is decided
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every thirteenth run does the weekly pass and the quarterly one. There is no
 * run-counter table, and adding one would be a second source of truth about a
 * schedule the cron already owns, so the thirteenth run is derived from the ISO
 * week itself: `weekIndex(week) % 13 === 0`. Deterministic, stateless, and
 * identical whether the cron fired it or an operator re-ran it. `?quarterly=1`
 * forces it for ops.
 *
 * The quarterly re-score reuses ../_shared/confusion.ts for every number and
 * recomputes none of them, and it MUTATES NOTHING. It reads the held-out set,
 * applies the current rubric's deterministic probes (../_shared/discrimination.ts,
 * the same probe machinery the compile stage scores with), builds the matrix,
 * and puts the report in this run's output. Retirements are listed and asked
 * about; nothing is retired here.
 *
 * The honest limit on that number, stated because it will be read: the probe is
 * a deterministic check, not the three-lens gate the review surface runs. It is
 * the strongest re-score available to a cron with no user JWT and no model
 * budget, it is exactly reproducible, and it is not the same instrument as
 * scripts/eval-skill.mjs. A criterion with no checkable observable contributes
 * nothing rather than a guess, and when no criterion on the surface has one the
 * item is 'insufficient', never a quiet 'holds'.
