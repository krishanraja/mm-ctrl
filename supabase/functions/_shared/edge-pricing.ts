// Stripe wants cents, the UI wants dollars. This file is the canonical value

//   - supabase/functions/create-edge-subscription/index.ts (server-side, Deno)
//   - src/constants/billing.ts                              (client-side, Vite)
//
// Plain TypeScript constants only — keep this file free of Deno or Node-only
// imports so both runtimes can read it.
