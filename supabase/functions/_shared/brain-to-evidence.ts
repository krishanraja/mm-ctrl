/**
 * brain-to-evidence: turn what CTRL already holds about a leader into stage-1
 * candidates for the harness chain.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT AN LLM PASS
 *
 * ingest-evidence exists to mine raw prose, so it needs a model to find the
 * claims inside it. A user_memory row is not raw prose. It has already been
 * extracted, categorised, scored for importance and, for some rows, confirmed
 * by the leader. Running a second model over it would add a fabrication surface
 * and nothing else, so this composes the source document and computes every
 * offset arithmetically. The quote for fact N is source.slice(start, end) by
 * construction rather than by hope, which is the same guarantee CH-13 asks for,
 * obtained for free.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO
 *
 * A held fact is a CANDIDATE, never a rule. ctrl-intake's first rule is that a
 * transcript produces candidates and only grading produces rules, and a fact
 * mined from memory is exactly a transcript's output wearing a nicer shape. So
 * every row here is situated = true, carries the situation it came from, and
 * every construct is status 'candidate' with NO contrast_pole. The sort makes
 * the second pole. Nothing in this file may write a standing row; the schema
 * would refuse it anyway (standing_requires_promotion), and that is deliberate.
 *
 * The FK evidence.memory_fact_id has existed since the spine migration with no
 * writer. This is the writer. It is what lets a rule in a built skill be traced
 * back to the fact in the brain that suggested it.
