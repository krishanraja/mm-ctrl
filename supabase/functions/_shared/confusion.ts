/**
 * confusion: the measurement arithmetic for stage 5 of the harness chain.
 *
 * Pure. No Deno imports, no network, no clock, no randomness. vitest runs this
 * file directly; scripts/eval-skill.mjs imports it and holds no measurement
 * logic of its own, and standard-render imports it so the file a person reads
 * and the script that produced the numbers cannot disagree.
 *
 * This is the stage that decides whether the product may use the word
 * "verified", so the whole module is written around one rule: a number that was
 * not measured is never printed, and an absent measurement is never rendered as
 * a zero. Those are two different facts about the world and collapsing them is
 * how a gate ends up claiming a precision it never had.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is measured, and why the positive class is "would not send"
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Does the gate agree with the person on work it never trained on. For each
 * held-out item the Standard lens runs over the body with the compiled rubric
 * loaded and exemplars drawn from the TRAINING set only, and its verdict is
 * compared to what the person said.
 *
 * "would not send" is the positive class, because catching what they would
 * reject is the job:
 *
 *     TP = person would_not_send, gate breaks
 *     FP = person send,           gate breaks   <- the ones that get it ignored
 *     FN = person would_not_send, gate holds
 *     TN = person send,           gate holds
 *
 * All three of precision, recall and TNR are reported SEPARATELY, and never
 * rolled into one agreement number. Raw agreement is misleading under class
 * imbalance (a gate that holds on everything scores well when the person sends
 * most things and is worth nothing), and the number that actually matters is
 * TNR on their rejects.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ruled challenges this implements
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   CH-03  The degenerate case is a first-class outcome, not an error path.
 *          When zero criteria load, the Standard lens judges against an empty
 *          rubric, TP and FP are both 0, and precision is 0/0. That is NaN,
 *          which satisfies neither row of 4.7b's release table and renders as
 *          "NaN" on the screen at item 30. So metricsFrom returns NULL for any
 *          zero-denominator metric: null is an absent measurement, 0 is a
 *          measured zero, and the two must stay distinguishable everywhere
 *          downstream. Callers render "baseline: none", never a figure.
 *
 *   CH-12  Self-agreement is the ceiling on precision and is reported beside
 *          it. An inconsistent grader produces the same signature as a
 *          confounded generator, and a gate cannot be more consistent than the
 *          person it was built from, so a grader whose repeats disagree caps
 *          the label at Provisional however good the arithmetic looks. That cap
 *          comes from the already-ruled triage in ./discrimination.ts rather
 *          than from a second copy of the rule.
 *
 * Thresholds are all [U] in the spec and every one of them lives in
 * ./discrimination.ts, marked PROVISIONAL, PENDING DATA. They are imported here
 * rather than restated, because two copies of a release threshold is how a
 * product ends up shipping under a bar nobody agreed to.
