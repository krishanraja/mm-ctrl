/**
 * capture-core: the deterministic half of stage 9, LEARN.
 *
 * Pure module. No Deno imports, no I/O, no clock and no randomness, so vitest
 * runs it directly and the same governed snapshot always produces the same
 * proposals. Everything that talks to the database lives in ../capture-week.
 *
 * `skills/ctrl-capture` is the managed reference implementation of exactly this
 * stage, and every rule below is lifted from it rather than reinvented:
 * `SKILL.md` for recurrence policy, routing and the size obligation,
 * `leaves/weekly.md` for the three types and the proposal shape,
 * `leaves/quarterly.md` for the rule that only a fresh untouched holdout can
 * create a new measurement, and `ctrl-check/reference/ledger.md` for what the
 * rows mean.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The one thing this stage may do, and the one thing it may never do
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * It writes a proposal. A named human accepts or rejects it. Nothing in this
 * file, and nothing in the function that calls it, edits a standard: there is
 * no code path here that produces a `criteria` write of any shape, and that is
 * a property of the module, not a promise about it. A standard that changes
 * without a decision is a standard nobody owns.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Recurrence, stated exactly
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * One occurrence is an observation: someone had a bad Tuesday, the document was
 * unusual, or the reviewer was wrong. It is logged and not promoted. The named
 * owner's policy defines the window and minimum unique evidence.
 *
 *     candidate(k) <=> count(unique evidence identities for k in window) >= policy.minimum
 *     window       =  policy.window_weeks ending at nowWeek, inclusive
 *
 * Occurrences are unique review events inside the window, not database rows.
 * A retry or changed answer on one review cannot manufacture recurrence. The
 * distinct weeks are reported alongside so the shape stays visible.
 *
 * Type C drift is the single exception, and it is allowed only because it asks
 * rather than acts: a criterion with zero firings may raise a question only
 * after applicable review exposure meets policy. Unknown exposure stays unknown.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is deliberately NOT here
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * No LLM selects anything. The three types and recurrence filter are
 * arithmetic over rows, and a model asked to pick out "what keeps coming up"
 * from a week of ledger will find something every single week, which is the
 * exact failure the recurrence rule exists to prevent (SKILL.md: "A weekly pass
 * that always finds something is a weekly pass inventing things to justify
 * itself"). A model may draft wording for candidates already chosen here; it may
 * never choose them.
 *
 * Method rows (4.10.2) and trigger rows (4.10.3) are grouped and counted, and
 * they are NOT turned into proposals: `proposals.type` admits three values and a
 * method correction amends a skill rather than a criterion. They are reported in
 * the run output so the gap is visible rather than silently dropped. Forcing a
 * method correction into a criterion proposal is the generalisation failure the
 * whole chain is built to stop.
