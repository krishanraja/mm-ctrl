## [5.2] — 2026-05 — Phase 8: Agent Skill Builder + World-Class Desktop Redesign

### Added
- **Agent Skill Builder** (PR #103): new edge function `generate-skill-export` (Edge Pro gated) implementing the full voice-to-Skill pipeline. Three Honest Tests triage gate routes Memory Facts / Custom Instructions / Saved Styles to the right surface instead of generating junk. Quality gate enforces 5+ trigger phrases, push language, third-person voice, body under 500 lines, imperative voice, required sections, valid name format. ZIP packaging follows the agentskills.io standard (`SKILL.md` + `references/` + test prompts + install guide). New `skill_exports` table with RLS + per-user log. Frontend: `SkillExportCard` on `/context` Step 1, `SkillCaptureSheet` (voice/text), `SkillPreviewSheet` (download + quality checklist + install guide for Claude Code / Claude.ai / Cursor). New hook `useSkillExport`.
- **World-class desktop UI redesign** (PR #104): unified desktop-native shell. New `AuthedLayoutRoute` wrapping authenticated routes in `CommandPaletteProvider`. Cmd/Ctrl+K Command Palette. Sticky top bar with page eyebrow + title + actions. Optional right rail. Refined sidebar with user footer + keyboard hints. Landing, Dashboard, Briefing, Export wizard all reworked. Mobile paths preserved. Pages opt into command-palette actions via custom `mm:capture-voice` and `mm:generate-briefing` window events.
- **Pain-anchored Skill entry points** (PR #105): `AutomatePainCard` on Edge view (chip row of blockers + active decisions), zap button on Memory Web blocker cards, zap button on Briefing `decision_trigger` segments (v1 + v2). Each entry point hands a `SkillSeed` via `location.state` to `/context`, which auto-opens `SkillCaptureSheet` pre-anchored. New hook `useUserPains` returns top blockers + active decisions for seeding.
- **Contrast + scroll polish** (PR #106): solid /15 tints + visible borders on warm pills + Skill Builder seed banner / pain picker. Dashboard Edge mobile scroller clears the floating mic FAB. Save/restore dashboard scroll position around `SkillCaptureSheet`. New hook `useRevealOnMount` for smooth below-the-fold reveals.

### Changed
- **Edge Pro** ($9/month) now also includes unlimited Agent Skill Builder generation + Custom Voice Export. No price change.
- `/context` Step 1: `SkillExportCard` promoted above the Custom Voice card; "Custom via Voice" renamed to "Custom context export" (was misleadingly claiming to produce a skill).
- `generate-skill-export` accepts optional `seed { kind, text }` in body; prompt grounds extraction in the leader's actual pain language when present.

### Verified counts at end of phase
- 74 edge functions
- 51 hooks
- 98 migrations
- 5 Vitest specs + 6 Playwright e2e specs

## [5.1] — 2026-04 — Phase 7: Six-Week Audit Hardening

The product survived six thematic audit weeks, each shipped as its own PR with a clear boundary.

### Added
- **Audit Week 1 — Revenue path** (PR #93): Mandatory Stripe webhook signature verification. New `stripe_events_processed` table for webhook idempotency. Briefing rate limits via `_shared/rateLimit.ts`. E2E test `tests/stripe-webhook-idempotency.spec.ts`.
- **Audit Week 2 — Data path** (PR #94): Closed assessment data leak. Codified `ctrl-briefings` storage bucket policy. End-to-end account deletion (Memory Web + briefings + audio + decisions + missions + assessments + all subordinate rows). E2E test `tests/account-deletion.spec.ts`.
- **Audit Week 3 — UX** (PR #95): Killed onboarding gate. Fixed NorthStar stub. Voice permission recovery. Killed surveillance copy. Removed all "coming soon" placeholders for unimplemented affordances.
- **Audit Week 4 — Reliability** (PR #99): New `_shared/with-timeout.ts` utility (with vitest coverage) wrapping every external API call. Audio failure UX so briefing card still renders if synthesis fails. Onboarding stall recovery.
- **Audit Week 5 — Observability** (PR #97): Structured edge-function JSON logger at `_shared/logger.ts`. CI gate prevents `console.log` regressions.
- **Audit Week 6 — Cleanup + e2e** (PR #98, #100, #101): P2 backlog closure. 5 more e2e specs (auth, briefing journey, briefing rate limits, sparse profile + the two from earlier weeks). New `ai_response_cache` table for lens + embedding caching. Lint cleanup.

### Changed
- All edge-function logging migrated to structured JSON via `_shared/logger.ts`
- All external API calls (Vertex, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Perplexity, Tavily, Brave, Resend, Stripe) now wrap in `with-timeout`
- `briefing_v2_enabled` opt-in flag honored across cold and cached lens paths

### Verified counts at end of phase
- 74 edge functions
- 48 hooks
- 97 migrations
- 6 Vitest specs + 6 Playwright e2e specs

## [5.0] — 2026-04 — Phase 6: Briefing v2 (Evidence-Based Relevance Pipeline)

### Added
- **Seven-stage briefing pipeline**: importance lens → query planner → multi-provider fan-out (Perplexity + Tavily + Brave, 12s cap) → embedding dedupe + scoring (`text-embedding-3-small` + pgvector) → budget-constrained curation → script generation (gpt-4o) → audio synthesis (ElevenLabs)
- Every retained segment carries `lens_item_id`, `relevance_score`, `matched_profile_fact` — auditable relevance, not asserted relevance
- `briefing-diagnose` edge function: read-only "why these stories?" endpoint
- `briefing_interests` table — user-declared beats / entities / excludes (Settings → Interests tab + inline Add buttons)
- `industry_beat_library` table — 11 industries pre-seeded (creator economy, SaaS, healthcare, finance/fintech, consulting, e-commerce/retail, media/publishing, edtech, biotech, legal, generic) with 6-8 beats × 4-7 entities each
- `briefing_lens_feedback` table — persistent semantic negative feedback. Explicit Ban writes -1.0 delta immediately. Aggregator (`sp_aggregate_briefing_feedback` plpgsql + pg_cron at 03:07 UTC) promotes 3+ thumbs-down on same signature to -0.4 delta.
- `briefing_v2_enabled` per-user opt-in flag + `BRIEFING_V2_ENABLED_DEFAULT` env var
- pgvector + pgcrypto + pg_cron extensions enabled

### Changed
- `briefings` table extended: `schema_version`, `segments` JSONB, `context_snapshot` JSONB
- `briefing_feedback` extended with `lens_item_id`, `dwell_ms`, `replayed`
- Briefing card on dashboard hoisted `SeedBeatsPrompt` above the briefing, added Bookmark + Ban + "Anchored to:" chips inline (PR #88)
