# CTRL: Clarity for Leaders

> Think out loud. See what emerges.

CTRL helps leaders voice their thoughts and organizes them into a **Memory Web** (your portable context that makes every AI smarter), an **Edge** profile (your leadership strengths amplified, weaknesses covered), **Context Exports** that make every AI tool you use instantly personal, and a **Daily Briefing** anchored to your real priorities.

**Build your portable AI double in 2 minutes. Hear 3 minutes of audio every morning that's actually about your world. Every AI tool you use already knows your context, goals, and thinking style.**

## The Problem

Every leader uses AI. But every AI conversation starts from zero. You re-explain who you are, what your company does, what you're working on, every single time. The advice stays generic. Decision speed suffers.

Plus the **noise tax** — newsletters and feeds serve everyone the same content. 30+ minutes a day for two useful insights at best.

CTRL eliminates both, permanently.

## How It Works

1. **Voice a thought** — 2 minutes, no typing
2. **It organizes itself** — Memory Web extracts and verifies structured facts
3. **Export anywhere** — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Claude Code, raw markdown
4. **Hear your world** — 3-minute audio Briefing every morning, every story anchored to a specific priority on your desk
5. **Every decision gets faster** — Edge artifacts, Decision Advisor, Meeting Prep already know your context

## Core Features

### Memory Web
Your thoughts, organized. A living map of what you know, what you want, and how you think. Facts are categorized, verified by you, and encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).

### Edge — Leadership Amplifier
Your strengths sharpened, your weaknesses covered. Edge synthesizes your Memory Web and assessment data into a leadership profile, then offers AI-powered capabilities:
- **Sharpen** strengths: Systemize, Teach, Lean Into
- **Cover** weaknesses: Board Memos, Strategy Docs, Emails, Meeting Agendas, Templates, Frameworks
- Interactive strength/weakness pills with feedback loops
- Intelligence gap detection with guided resolution
- Edge Pro ($9/month) for unlimited artifact generation + email delivery

### Daily Briefing v2 — Evidence-based intelligence
Three minutes of audio every morning, tuned to the one thing that matters: your world.

- Every segment is **anchored** to something specific in your profile (the card literally shows "Anchored to: <your active decision>")
- **Bookmark** any story → its anchor becomes a persistent beat
- **Ban** any topic → kills it semantically (embeddings-based, not keyword)
- **Settings → Interests** → declare beats, track people/companies, exclude topics
- Cold-start solved: 11 industries pre-seeded with relevant starter beats
- Seven briefing types: Daily Brief, Macro Trends, Vendor Landscape, Competitive Intel, Boardroom Prep, AI Model Landscape, Custom Voice
- Persistent learning: explicit Bans (-1.0 immediately) + nightly aggregator (-0.4 after 3+ thumbs-down on same signature)

### Context Export — Your Context, Everywhere
One click to export your context to **any** AI tool:
- **ChatGPT** — Custom instructions
- **Claude** — Conversation context
- **Gemini** — Formatted context
- **Cursor** — `.cursorrules` file
- **Claude Code** — `CLAUDE.md` file
- **Raw Markdown** — Use anywhere

Optimized for: General Advisor, Meeting Prep, Decision Support, Code Review, Email Drafting, Strategic Planning.

### Thinking Tools
- **Decision Advisor** — Think through a decision with full context
- **Meeting Prep** — Walk in prepared
- **Team Brief** — Draft instructions for your team
- **Stream of Consciousness** — Speak freely. It organizes itself.

### AI Literacy Diagnostic

## Architecture (high level)

The app uses a **unified dashboard** architecture. The Dashboard page (`/dashboard`) is the primary hub, rendering either the Memory Web view (default) or the Edge view (`?view=edge`). Desktop uses a persistent sidebar; mobile uses a bottom navigation bar.

### Active Routes

| Route | Page | Auth |
|-------|------|------|
| `/` | Landing | No |
| `/auth` | Auth (Email + Google OAuth) | No |
| `/auth/callback` | OAuth redirect handler | No |
| `/booking` | Booking | No |
| `/dashboard` | Dashboard hub (Memory Web view by default; `?view=edge` for Edge) | Yes |
| `/memory` | Memory Center | Yes |
| `/context` | Context Export | Yes |
| `/briefing` | Daily Briefing page | Yes |
| `/settings` | Settings | Yes |
| `/compliance` | Compliance | Yes |
| `/profile` | Profile | Yes |

Legacy routes (`/today`, `/voice`, `/pulse`, `/diagnostic`, `/think`) redirect to `/dashboard`.

## Production Hardening (April 2026 audit cycle)

The product survived a six-week audit-track program. Each week landed as its own PR with a clear thematic boundary:

| Week | Theme | What shipped |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Revenue path | Mandatory Stripe webhook signature verification + idempotency table; briefing rate limits |
| 2 | Data path | Closed assessment data leak; codified storage bucket; end-to-end account deletion |
| 3 | UX | Killed onboarding gate; voice permission recovery; killed surveillance copy; removed all "coming soon" placeholders |
| 4 | Reliability | `with-timeout` utility wrapping all external API calls (tested); audio failure UX; onboarding stall recovery |
| 5 | Observability | Structured edge-function JSON logger; CI gate against `console.log` regressions |
| 6 | Cleanup + e2e | P2 backlog; 6 e2e specs covering riskiest paths; AI response cache; lint cleanup |

E2E specs covering the highest-risk paths:
- `tests/auth-journeys.spec.ts`
- `tests/briefing-journey.spec.ts`
- `tests/briefing-rate-limits.spec.ts`
- `tests/sparse-profile.spec.ts`
- `tests/account-deletion.spec.ts`
- `tests/stripe-webhook-idempotency.spec.ts`
