# CTRL: Clarity for Leaders

> Think out loud. See what emerges.

CTRL helps leaders voice their thoughts and organizes them into a **Memory Web** (your portable context that makes every AI smarter), an **Edge** profile (your leadership strengths amplified, weaknesses covered), and **Context Exports** that make every AI tool you use instantly personal.

**Build your portable AI double in 2 minutes. Every AI tool you use instantly knows your context, goals, and thinking style.**

---

## The Problem

Every leader uses AI. But every AI conversation starts from zero. You re-explain who you are, what your company does, what you're working on, every single time. The advice stays generic. Decision speed suffers.

CTRL eliminates that friction permanently.

## How It Works

1. **Voice a thought**
2. **It organizes itself**
3. **Export anywhere** - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Claude Code
4. **Every decision gets faster**

2 minutes to your first export. Voice-first, text always available.

## Core Features

### Memory Web
Your thoughts, organized. A living map of what you know, what you want, and how you think. Facts are categorized, verified by you, and encrypted at rest.

### Edge: Leadership Amplifier
Your strengths sharpened, your weaknesses covered. Edge synthesizes your Memory Web and assessment data into a leadership profile, then offers AI-powered capabilities:
- **Sharpen** strengths: Systemize, Teach, Lean Into
- **Cover** weaknesses: Board Memos, Strategy Docs, Emails, Meeting Agendas, Templates
- Interactive strength/weakness pills with feedback loops
- Intelligence gap detection with guided resolution
- Pro tier with premium artifact generation

### Context Export: Your Context, Everywhere
One click to export your context to **any** AI tool:
- **ChatGPT** - Custom instructions
- **Claude** - Conversation context
- **Gemini** - Formatted context
- **Cursor** - .cursorrules file
- **Claude Code** - CLAUDE.md file
- **Raw Markdown** - Use anywhere

Export optimized for specific use cases: General Advisor, Meeting Prep, Decision Support, Code Review, Email Drafting, Strategic Planning.

### Thinking Tools
Four tools that think with your context:
- **Decision Advisor** - Think through a decision with full context
- **Meeting Prep** - Walk in prepared
- **Team Brief** - Draft instructions for your team
- **Stream of Consciousness** - Speak freely. It organizes itself.

### AI Literacy Diagnostic

## Architecture

The app uses a **unified dashboard** architecture. The Dashboard page (`/dashboard`) is the primary hub, rendering either the Memory Web view (default) or the Edge view (`?view=edge`). Desktop uses a persistent sidebar; mobile uses a bottom navigation bar.

### Active Routes

| Route | Page | Auth | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| `/` | Landing | No | Video background hero, CTRL branding |
| `/auth` | Auth | No | Email + Google OAuth |
| `/auth/callback` | Auth Callback | No | OAuth redirect handler |
| `/booking` | Booking | No | External booking page |
| `/dashboard` | Dashboard (Memory Web) | Yes | Default view - Memory Web with guided first experience |
| `/dashboard?view=edge` | Dashboard (Edge) | Yes | Edge leadership amplifier |
| `/memory` | Memory Center | Yes | Detailed memory management |
| `/context` | Context Export | Yes | Export to AI tools |
| `/settings` | Settings | Yes | User preferences |
| `/profile` | Profile | Yes | User profile |

Legacy routes (`/today`, `/voice`, `/pulse`, `/diagnostic`, `/think`) redirect to `/dashboard`.

### Navigation Structure

**Desktop:** Fixed left sidebar (264px) with CTRL logo, nav items (Home, Edge, Memory Web, Export to AI), settings, and sign out.

**Mobile:** Bottom navigation bar with 4 tabs: Home, Edge, Memory, Export.
